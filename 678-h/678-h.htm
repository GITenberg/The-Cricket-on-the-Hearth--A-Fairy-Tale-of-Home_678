<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;Chirp the First</h2>
<p>The kettle began it!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me what Mrs.
Peerybingle said.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; Mrs. Peerybingle may
leave it on record to the end of time that she couldn&rsquo;t say
which of them began it; but, I say the kettle did.&nbsp; I ought
to know, I hope!&nbsp; The kettle began it, full five minutes by
the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the
Cricket uttered a chirp.</p>
<p>As if the clock hadn&rsquo;t finished striking, and the
convulsive little Haymaker at the top of it, jerking away right
and left with a scythe in front of a Moorish Palace, hadn&rsquo;t
mowed down half an acre of imaginary grass before the Cricket
joined in at all!</p>
<p>Why, I am not naturally positive.&nbsp; Every one knows
that.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t set my own opinion against the
opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were quite sure, on any
account whatever.&nbsp; Nothing should induce me.&nbsp; But, this
is a question of fact.&nbsp; And the fact is, that the kettle
began it, at least five minutes before the Cricket gave any sign
of being in existence.&nbsp; Contradict me, and I&rsquo;ll say
ten.</p>
<p>Let me narrate exactly how it happened.&nbsp; I should have
proceeded to do so in my very first word, but for this plain
consideration&mdash;if I am to tell a story I must begin at the
beginning; and how is it possible to begin at the beginning,
without beginning at the kettle?</p>
<p>It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of
skill, you must understand, between the kettle and the
Cricket.&nbsp; And this is what led to it, and how it came
about.</p>
<p>Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight, and
clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked
innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in Euclid
all about the yard&mdash;Mrs. Peerybingle filled the kettle at
the water-butt.&nbsp; Presently returning, less the pattens (and
a good deal less, for they were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle was but
short), she set the kettle on the fire.&nbsp; In doing which she
lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant; for, the water
being uncomfortably cold, and in that slippy, slushy, sleety sort
of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of
substance, patten rings included&mdash;had laid hold of Mrs.
Peerybingle&rsquo;s toes, and even splashed her legs.&nbsp; And
when we rather plume ourselves (with reason too) upon our legs,
and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings, we
find this, for the moment, hard to bear.</p>
<p>Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate.&nbsp; It
wouldn&rsquo;t allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar; it
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs
of coal; it <i>would</i> lean forward with a drunken air, and
dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle, on the hearth.&nbsp; It was
quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered morosely at the
fire.&nbsp; To sum up all, the lid, resisting Mrs.
Peerybingle&rsquo;s fingers, first of all turned topsy-turvy, and
then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause,
dived sideways in&mdash;down to the very bottom of the
kettle.&nbsp; And the hull of the Royal George has never made
half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water, which
the lid of that kettle employed against Mrs. Peerybingle, before
she got it up again.</p>
<p>It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then; carrying
its handle with an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly
and mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, &lsquo;I
won&rsquo;t boil.&nbsp; Nothing shall induce me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour, dusted her
chubby little hands against each other, and sat down before the
kettle, laughing.&nbsp; Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and
fell, flashing and gleaming on the little Haymaker at the top of
the Dutch clock, until one might have thought he stood stock
still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing was in motion but
the flame.</p>
<p>He was on the move, however; and had his spasms, two to the
second, all right and regular.&nbsp; But, his sufferings when the
clock was going to strike, were frightful to behold; and, when a
Cuckoo looked out of a trap-door in the Palace, and gave note six
times, it shook him, each time, like a spectral voice&mdash;or
like a something wiry, plucking at his legs.</p>
<p>It was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise
among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided, that
this terrified Haymaker became himself again.&nbsp; Nor was he
startled without reason; for these rattling, bony skeletons of
clocks are very disconcerting in their operation, and I wonder
very much how any set of men, but most of all how Dutchmen, can
have had a liking to invent them.&nbsp; There is a popular belief
that Dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own
lower selves; and they might know better than to leave their
clocks so very lank and unprotected, surely.</p>
<p>Now it was, you observe, that the kettle began to spend the
evening.&nbsp; Now it was, that the kettle, growing mellow and
musical, began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and
to indulge in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud, as
if it hadn&rsquo;t quite made up its mind yet, to be good
company.&nbsp; Now it was, that after two or three such vain
attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments, it threw off all
moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of song so cosy
and hilarious, as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least
idea of.</p>
<p>So plain too!&nbsp; Bless you, you might have understood it
like a book&mdash;better than some books you and I could name,
perhaps.&nbsp; With its warm breath gushing forth in a light
cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet, then hung
about the chimney-corner as its own domestic Heaven, it trolled
its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its iron
body hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the lid itself, the
recently rebellious lid&mdash;such is the influence of a bright
example&mdash;performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf
and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin
brother.</p>
<p>That this song of the kettle&rsquo;s was a song of invitation
and welcome to somebody out of doors: to somebody at that moment
coming on, towards the snug small home and the crisp fire: there
is no doubt whatever.&nbsp; Mrs. Peerybingle knew it, perfectly,
as she sat musing before the hearth.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dark
night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the
way; and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is
mire and clay; and there&rsquo;s only one relief in all the sad
and murky air; and I don&rsquo;t know that it is one, for
it&rsquo;s nothing but a glare; of deep and angry crimson, where
the sun and wind together; set a brand upon the clouds for being
guilty of such weather; and the widest open country is a long
dull streak of black; and there&rsquo;s hoar-frost on the
finger-post, and thaw upon the track; and the ice it isn&rsquo;t
water, and the water isn&rsquo;t free; and you couldn&rsquo;t say
that anything is what it ought to be; but he&rsquo;s coming,
coming, coming!&mdash;</p>
<p>And here, if you like, the Cricket <span
class="GutSmall">DID</span> chime in! with a Chirrup, Chirrup,
Chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus; with a voice so
astoundingly disproportionate to its size, as compared with the
kettle; (size! you couldn&rsquo;t see it!) that if it had then
and there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had fallen
a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little body into fifty
pieces, it would have seemed a natural and inevitable
consequence, for which it had expressly laboured.</p>
<p>The kettle had had the last of its solo performance.&nbsp; It
persevered with undiminished ardour; but the Cricket took first
fiddle and kept it.&nbsp; Good Heaven, how it chirped!&nbsp; Its
shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded through the house, and
seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star.&nbsp; There
was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it, at its
loudest, which suggested its being carried off its legs, and made
to leap again, by its own intense enthusiasm.&nbsp; Yet they went
very well together, the Cricket and the kettle.&nbsp; The burden
of the song was still the same; and louder, louder, louder still,
they sang it in their emulation.</p>
<p>The fair little listener&mdash;for fair she was, and young:
though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I
don&rsquo;t myself object to that&mdash;lighted a candle, glanced
at the Haymaker on the top of the clock, who was getting in a
pretty average crop of minutes; and looked out of the window,
where she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face
imaged in the glass.&nbsp; And my opinion is (and so would yours
have been), that she might have looked a long way, and seen
nothing half so agreeable.&nbsp; When she came back, and sat down
in her former seat, the Cricket and the kettle were still keeping
it up, with a perfect fury of competition.&nbsp; The
kettle&rsquo;s weak side clearly being, that he didn&rsquo;t know
when he was beat.</p>
<p>There was all the excitement of a race about it.&nbsp; Chirp,
chirp, chirp!&nbsp; Cricket a mile ahead.&nbsp; Hum, hum,
hum&mdash;m&mdash;m!&nbsp; Kettle making play in the distance,
like a great top.&nbsp; Chirp, chirp, chirp!&nbsp; Cricket round
the corner.&nbsp; Hum, hum, hum&mdash;m&mdash;m!&nbsp; Kettle
sticking to him in his own way; no idea of giving in.&nbsp;
Chirp, chirp, chirp!&nbsp; Cricket fresher than ever.&nbsp; Hum,
hum, hum&mdash;m&mdash;m!&nbsp; Kettle slow and steady.&nbsp;
Chirp, chirp, chirp!&nbsp; Cricket going in to finish him.&nbsp;
Hum, hum, hum&mdash;m&mdash;m!&nbsp; Kettle not to be
finished.&nbsp; Until at last they got so jumbled together, in
the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that whether the
kettle chirped and the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and
the kettle hummed, or they both chirped and both hummed, it would
have taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have decided with
anything like certainty.&nbsp; But, of this, there is no doubt:
that, the kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and
by some power of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent,
each, his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the
candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down the
lane.&nbsp; And this light, bursting on a certain person who, on
the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed
the whole thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried,
&lsquo;Welcome home, old fellow!&nbsp; Welcome home, my
boy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over,
and was taken off the fire.&nbsp; Mrs. Peerybingle then went
running to the door, where, what with the wheels of a cart, the
tramp of a horse, the voice of a man, the tearing in and out of
an excited dog, and the surprising and mysterious appearance of a
baby, there was soon the very What&rsquo;s-his-name to pay.</p>
<p>Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peerybingle got hold of
it in that flash of time, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But a
live baby there was, in Mrs. Peerybingle&rsquo;s arms; and a
pretty tolerable amount of pride she seemed to have in it, when
she was drawn gently to the fire, by a sturdy figure of a man,
much taller and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long
way down, to kiss her.&nbsp; But she was worth the trouble.&nbsp;
Six foot six, with the lumbago, might have done it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh goodness, John!&rsquo; said Mrs. P.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What a state you are in with the weather!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was something the worse for it, undeniably.&nbsp; The thick
mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw; and
between the fog and fire together, there were rainbows in his
very whiskers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you see, Dot,&rsquo; John made answer, slowly, as
he unrolled a shawl from about his throat; and warmed his hands;
&lsquo;it&mdash;it an&rsquo;t exactly summer weather.&nbsp; So,
no wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t call me Dot, John.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Peerybingle: pouting in a
way that clearly showed she <i>did</i> like it, very much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why what else are you?&rsquo; returned John, looking
down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as light a
squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give.&nbsp; &lsquo;A dot
and&rsquo;&mdash;here he glanced at the baby&mdash;&lsquo;a dot
and carry&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say it, for fear I should spoil it;
but I was very near a joke.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know as ever I
was nearer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was often near to something or other very clever, by his
own account: this lumbering, slow, honest John; this John so
heavy, but so light of spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so
gentle at the core; so dull without, so quick within; so stolid,
but so good!&nbsp; Oh Mother Nature, give thy children the true
poetry of heart that hid itself in this poor Carrier&rsquo;s
breast&mdash;he was but a Carrier by the way&mdash;and we can
bear to have them talking prose, and leading lives of prose; and
bear to bless thee for their company!</p>
<p>It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure, and her
baby in her arms: a very doll of a baby: glancing with a
coquettish thoughtfulness at the fire, and inclining her delicate
little head just enough on one side to let it rest in an odd,
half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling and agreeable
manner, on the great rugged figure of the Carrier.&nbsp; It was
pleasant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeavouring to
adapt his rude support to her slight need, and make his burly
middle-age a leaning-staff not inappropriate to her blooming
youth.&nbsp; It was pleasant to observe how Tilly Slowboy,
waiting in the background for the baby, took special cognizance
(though in her earliest teens) of this grouping; and stood with
her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust forward, taking
it in as if it were air.&nbsp; Nor was it less agreeable to
observe how John the Carrier, reference being made by Dot to the
aforesaid baby, checked his hand when on the point of touching
the infant, as if he thought he might crack it; and bending down,
surveyed it from a safe distance, with a kind of puzzled pride,
such as an amiable mastiff might be supposed to show, if he found
himself, one day, the father of a young canary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An&rsquo;t he beautiful, John?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t he
look precious in his sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very precious,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very much
so.&nbsp; He generally <i>is</i> asleep, an&rsquo;t
he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lor, John!&nbsp; Good gracious no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said John, pondering.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought
his eyes was generally shut.&nbsp; Halloa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Goodness, John, how you startle one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It an&rsquo;t right for him to turn &rsquo;em up in
that way!&rsquo; said the astonished Carrier, &lsquo;is it?&nbsp;
See how he&rsquo;s winking with both of &rsquo;em at once!&nbsp;
And look at his mouth!&nbsp; Why he&rsquo;s gasping like a gold
and silver fish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t deserve to be a father, you
don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Dot, with all the dignity of an
experienced matron.&nbsp; &lsquo;But how should you know what
little complaints children are troubled with, John!&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t so much as know their names, you stupid
fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when she had turned the baby over on her
left arm, and had slapped its back as a restorative, she pinched
her husband&rsquo;s ear, laughing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said John, pulling off his outer coat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very true, Dot.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much
about it.&nbsp; I only know that I&rsquo;ve been fighting pretty
stiffly with the wind to-night.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been blowing
north-east, straight into the cart, the whole way
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor old man, so it has!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Peerybingle,
instantly becoming very active.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here!&nbsp; Take the
precious darling, Tilly, while I make myself of some use.&nbsp;
Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I could!&nbsp; Hie
then, good dog!&nbsp; Hie, Boxer, boy!&nbsp; Only let me make the
tea first, John; and then I&rsquo;ll help you with the parcels,
like a busy bee.&nbsp; &ldquo;How doth the
little&rdquo;&mdash;and all the rest of it, you know, John.&nbsp;
Did you ever learn &ldquo;how doth the little,&rdquo; when you
went to school, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to quite know it,&rsquo; John returned.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was very near it once.&nbsp; But I should only have
spoilt it, I dare say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha ha,&rsquo; laughed Dot.&nbsp; She had the blithest
little laugh you ever heard.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a dear old darling
of a dunce you are, John, to be sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not at all disputing this position, John went out to see that
the boy with the lantern, which had been dancing to and fro
before the door and window, like a Will of the Wisp, took due
care of the horse; who was fatter than you would quite believe,
if I gave you his measure, and so old that his birthday was lost
in the mists of antiquity.&nbsp; Boxer, feeling that his
attentions were due to the family in general, and must be
impartially distributed, dashed in and out with bewildering
inconstancy; now, describing a circle of short barks round the
horse, where he was being rubbed down at the stable-door; now
feigning to make savage rushes at his mistress, and facetiously
bringing himself to sudden stops; now, eliciting a shriek from
Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair near the fire, by the
unexpected application of his moist nose to her countenance; now,
exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby; now, going round
and round upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had
established himself for the night; now, getting up again, and
taking that nothing of a fag-end of a tail of his, out into the
weather, as if he had just remembered an appointment, and was
off, at a round trot, to keep it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the teapot, ready on the
hob!&rsquo; said Dot; as briskly busy as a child at play at
keeping house.&nbsp; &lsquo;And there&rsquo;s the old knuckle of
ham; and there&rsquo;s the butter; and there&rsquo;s the crusty
loaf, and all!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the clothes-basket for the
small parcels, John, if you&rsquo;ve got any there&mdash;where
are you, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let the dear child fall under the grate,
Tilly, whatever you do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted of Miss Slowboy, in spite of her rejecting the
caution with some vivacity, that she had a rare and surprising
talent for getting this baby into difficulties and had several
times imperilled its short life, in a quiet way peculiarly her
own.&nbsp; She was of a spare and straight shape, this young
lady, insomuch that her garments appeared to be in constant
danger of sliding off those sharp pegs, her shoulders, on which
they were loosely hung.&nbsp; Her costume was remarkable for the
partial development, on all possible occasions, of some flannel
vestment of a singular structure; also for affording glimpses, in
the region of the back, of a corset, or pair of stays, in colour
a dead-green.&nbsp; Being always in a state of gaping admiration
at everything, and absorbed, besides, in the perpetual
contemplation of her mistress&rsquo;s perfections and the
baby&rsquo;s, Miss Slowboy, in her little errors of judgment, may
be said to have done equal honour to her head and to her heart;
and though these did less honour to the baby&rsquo;s head, which
they were the occasional means of bringing into contact with deal
doors, dressers, stair-rails, bed-posts, and other foreign
substances, still they were the honest results of Tilly
Slowboy&rsquo;s constant astonishment at finding herself so
kindly treated, and installed in such a comfortable home.&nbsp;
For, the maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to
Fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity, a foundling;
which word, though only differing from fondling by one
vowel&rsquo;s length, is very different in meaning, and expresses
quite another thing.</p>
<p>To have seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back with her
husband, tugging at the clothes-basket, and making the most
strenuous exertions to do nothing at all (for he carried it),
would have amused you almost as much as it amused him.&nbsp; It
may have entertained the Cricket too, for anything I know; but,
certainly, it now began to chirp again, vehemently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heyday!&rsquo; said John, in his slow way.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s merrier than ever, to-night, I
think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s sure to bring us good fortune,
John!&nbsp; It always has done so.&nbsp; To have a Cricket on the
Hearth, is the luckiest thing in all the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John looked at her as if he had very nearly got the thought
into his head, that she was his Cricket in chief, and he quite
agreed with her.&nbsp; But, it was probably one of his narrow
escapes, for he said nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John,
was on that night when you brought me home&mdash;when you brought
me to my new home here; its little mistress.&nbsp; Nearly a year
ago.&nbsp; You recollect, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>O yes.&nbsp; John remembered.&nbsp; I should think so!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Its chirp was such a welcome to me!&nbsp; It seemed so
full of promise and encouragement.&nbsp; It seemed to say, you
would be kind and gentle with me, and would not expect (I had a
fear of that, John, then) to find an old head on the shoulders of
your foolish little wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>John thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and then the
head, as though he would have said No, no; he had had no such
expectation; he had been quite content to take them as they
were.&nbsp; And really he had reason.&nbsp; They were very
comely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say so; for
you have ever been, I am sure, the best, the most considerate,
the most affectionate of husbands to me.&nbsp; This has been a
happy home, John; and I love the Cricket for its sake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so do I then,&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So do I, Dot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love it for the many times I have heard it, and the
many thoughts its harmless music has given me.&nbsp; Sometimes,
in the twilight, when I have felt a little solitary and
down-hearted, John&mdash;before baby was here to keep me company
and make the house gay&mdash;when I have thought how lonely you
would be if I should die; how lonely I should be if I could know
that you had lost me, dear; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon the
hearth, has seemed to tell me of another little voice, so sweet,
so very dear to me, before whose coming sound my trouble vanished
like a dream.&nbsp; And when I used to fear&mdash;I did fear
once, John, I was very young you know&mdash;that ours might prove
to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child, and you
more like my guardian than my husband; and that you might not,
however hard you tried, be able to learn to love me, as you hoped
and prayed you might; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me up
again, and filled me with new trust and confidence.&nbsp; I was
thinking of these things to-night, dear, when I sat expecting
you; and I love the Cricket for their sake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so do I,&rsquo; repeated John.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,
Dot?&nbsp; <i>I</i> hope and pray that I might learn to love
you?&nbsp; How you talk!&nbsp; I had learnt that, long before I
brought you here, to be the Cricket&rsquo;s little mistress,
Dot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand, an instant, on his arm, and looked up at
him with an agitated face, as if she would have told him
something.&nbsp; Next moment she was down upon her knees before
the basket, speaking in a sprightly voice, and busy with the
parcels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are not many of them to-night, John, but I saw
some goods behind the cart, just now; and though they give more
trouble, perhaps, still they pay as well; so we have no reason to
grumble, have we?&nbsp; Besides, you have been delivering, I dare
say, as you came along?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; John said.&nbsp; &lsquo;A good
many.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why what&rsquo;s this round box?&nbsp; Heart alive,
John, it&rsquo;s a wedding-cake!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave a woman alone to find out that,&rsquo; said John,
admiringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now a man would never have thought of
it.&nbsp; Whereas, it&rsquo;s my belief that if you was to pack a
wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up bedstead, or a
pickled salmon keg, or any unlikely thing, a woman would be sure
to find it out directly.&nbsp; Yes; I called for it at the
pastry-cook&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it weighs I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;whole
hundredweights!&rsquo; cried Dot, making a great demonstration of
trying to lift it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose is it, John?&nbsp; Where is it going?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Read the writing on the other side,&rsquo; said
John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, John!&nbsp; My Goodness, John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! who&rsquo;d have thought it!&rsquo; John
returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never mean to say,&rsquo; pursued Dot, sitting on
the floor and shaking her head at him, &lsquo;that it&rsquo;s
Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John nodded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least.&nbsp; Not
in assent&mdash;in dumb and pitying amazement; screwing up her
lips the while with all their little force (they were never made
for screwing up; I am clear of that), and looking the good
Carrier through and through, in her abstraction.&nbsp; Miss
Slowboy, in the mean time, who had a mechanical power of
reproducing scraps of current conversation for the delectation of
the baby, with all the sense struck out of them, and all the
nouns changed into the plural number, inquired aloud of that
young creature, Was it Gruffs and Tackletons the toymakers then,
and Would it call at Pastry-cooks for wedding-cakes, and Did its
mothers know the boxes when its fathers brought them homes; and
so on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that is really to come about!&rsquo; said
Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, she and I were girls at school together,
John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He might have been thinking of her, or nearly thinking of her,
perhaps, as she was in that same school time.&nbsp; He looked
upon her with a thoughtful pleasure, but he made no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he&rsquo;s as old!&nbsp; As unlike her!&mdash;Why,
how many years older than you, is Gruff and Tackleton,
John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night at one
sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I
wonder!&rsquo; replied John, good-humouredly, as he drew a chair
to the round table, and began at the cold ham.&nbsp; &lsquo;As to
eating, I eat but little; but that little I enjoy,
Dot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even this, his usual sentiment at meal times, one of his
innocent delusions (for his appetite was always obstinate, and
flatly contradicted him), awoke no smile in the face of his
little wife, who stood among the parcels, pushing the cake-box
slowly from her with her foot, and never once looked, though her
eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she generally was
so mindful of.&nbsp; Absorbed in thought, she stood there,
heedless alike of the tea and John (although he called to her,
and rapped the table with his knife to startle her), until he
rose and touched her on the arm; when she looked at him for a
moment, and hurried to her place behind the teaboard, laughing at
her negligence.&nbsp; But, not as she had laughed before.&nbsp;
The manner and the music were quite changed.</p>
<p>The Cricket, too, had stopped.&nbsp; Somehow the room was not
so cheerful as it had been.&nbsp; Nothing like it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?&rsquo;
she said, breaking a long silence, which the honest Carrier had
devoted to the practical illustration of one part of his
favourite sentiment&mdash;certainly enjoying what he ate, if it
couldn&rsquo;t be admitted that he ate but little.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So, these are all the parcels; are they, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo; laying down his knife
and fork, and taking a long breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
declare&mdash;I&rsquo;ve clean forgotten the old
gentleman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the cart,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was
asleep, among the straw, the last time I saw him.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve very nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in;
but he went out of my head again.&nbsp; Halloa!&nbsp; Yahip
there!&nbsp; Rouse up!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my hearty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>John said these latter words outside the door, whither he had
hurried with the candle in his hand.</p>
<p>Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious reference to The
Old Gentleman, and connecting in her mystified imagination
certain associations of a religious nature with the phrase, was
so disturbed, that hastily rising from the low chair by the fire
to seek protection near the skirts of her mistress, and coming
into contact as she crossed the doorway with an ancient Stranger,
she instinctively made a charge or butt at him with the only
offensive instrument within her reach.&nbsp; This instrument
happening to be the baby, great commotion and alarm ensued, which
the sagacity of Boxer rather tended to increase; for, that good
dog, more thoughtful than its master, had, it seemed, been
watching the old gentleman in his sleep, lest he should walk off
with a few young poplar trees that were tied up behind the cart;
and he still attended on him very closely, worrying his gaiters
in fact, and making dead sets at the buttons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re such an undeniable good sleeper,
sir,&rsquo; said John, when tranquillity was restored; in the
mean time the old gentleman had stood, bareheaded and motionless,
in the centre of the room; &lsquo;that I have half a mind to ask
you where the other six are&mdash;only that would be a joke, and
I know I should spoil it.&nbsp; Very near though,&rsquo; murmured
the Carrier, with a chuckle; &lsquo;very near!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Stranger, who had long white hair, good features,
singularly bold and well defined for an old man, and dark,
bright, penetrating eyes, looked round with a smile, and saluted
the Carrier&rsquo;s wife by gravely inclining his head.</p>
<p>His garb was very quaint and odd&mdash;a long, long way behind
the time.&nbsp; Its hue was brown, all over.&nbsp; In his hand he
held a great brown club or walking-stick; and striking this upon
the floor, it fell asunder, and became a chair.&nbsp; On which he
sat down, quite composedly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said the Carrier, turning to his
wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way I found him, sitting by
the roadside!&nbsp; Upright as a milestone.&nbsp; And almost as
deaf.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sitting in the open air, John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the open air,&rsquo; replied the Carrier,
&lsquo;just at dusk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carriage Paid,&rdquo; he said;
and gave me eighteenpence.&nbsp; Then he got in.&nbsp; And there
he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going, John, I think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not at all.&nbsp; He was only going to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please, I was to be left till called for,&rsquo;
said the Stranger, mildly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that, he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large
pockets, and a book from another, and leisurely began to
read.&nbsp; Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house
lamb!</p>
<p>The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity.&nbsp;
The Stranger raised his head; and glancing from the latter to the
former, said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your daughter, my good friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wife,&rsquo; returned John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Niece?&rsquo; said the Stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wife,&rsquo; roared John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; observed the Stranger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely?&nbsp; Very young!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading.&nbsp; But,
before he could have read two lines, he again interrupted himself
to say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Baby, yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an answer in the
affirmative, delivered through a speaking trumpet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bo-o-oy!&rsquo; roared John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Also very young, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two months
and three da-ays!&nbsp; Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o!&nbsp;
Took very fine-ly!&nbsp; Considered, by the doctor, a remarkably
beautiful chi-ild!&nbsp; Equal to the general run of children at
five months o-old!&nbsp; Takes notice, in a way quite
won-der-ful!&nbsp; May seem impossible to you, but feels his legs
al-ready!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the breathless little mother, who had been shrieking
these short sentences into the old man&rsquo;s ear, until her
pretty face was crimsoned, held up the Baby before him as a
stubborn and triumphant fact; while Tilly Slowboy, with a
melodious cry of &lsquo;Ketcher, Ketcher&rsquo;&mdash;which
sounded like some unknown words, adapted to a popular
Sneeze&mdash;performed some cow-like gambols round that all
unconscious Innocent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hark!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s called for, sure enough,&rsquo;
said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s somebody at the door.&nbsp;
Open it, Tilly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before she could reach it, however, it was opened from
without; being a primitive sort of door, with a latch, that any
one could lift if he chose&mdash;and a good many people did
choose, for all kinds of neighbours liked to have a cheerful word
or two with the Carrier, though he was no great talker
himself.&nbsp; Being opened, it gave admission to a little,
meagre, thoughtful, dingy-faced man, who seemed to have made
himself a great-coat from the sack-cloth covering of some old
box; for, when he turned to shut the door, and keep the weather
out, he disclosed upon the back of that garment, the inscription
G &amp; T in large black capitals.&nbsp; Also the word GLASS in
bold characters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good evening, John!&rsquo; said the little man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good evening, Mum.&nbsp; Good evening, Tilly.&nbsp; Good
evening, Unbeknown!&nbsp; How&rsquo;s Baby, Mum?&nbsp;
Boxer&rsquo;s pretty well I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All thriving, Caleb,&rsquo; replied Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am sure you need only look at the dear child, for one, to know
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m sure I need only look at you for
another,&rsquo; said Caleb.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look at her though; he had a wandering and
thoughtful eye which seemed to be always projecting itself into
some other time and place, no matter what he said; a description
which will equally apply to his voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or at John for another,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Or at Tilly, as far as that goes.&nbsp; Or certainly at
Boxer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Busy just now, Caleb?&rsquo; asked the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, pretty well, John,&rsquo; he returned, with the
distraught air of a man who was casting about for the
Philosopher&rsquo;s stone, at least.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty much
so.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s rather a run on Noah&rsquo;s Arks at
present.&nbsp; I could have wished to improve upon the Family,
but I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s to be done at the
price.&nbsp; It would be a satisfaction to one&rsquo;s mind, to
make it clearer which was Shems and Hams, and which was
Wives.&nbsp; Flies an&rsquo;t on that scale neither, as compared
with elephants you know!&nbsp; Ah! well!&nbsp; Have you got
anything in the parcel line for me, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had
taken off; and brought out, carefully preserved in moss and
paper, a tiny flower-pot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There it is!&rsquo; he said, adjusting it with great
care.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not so much as a leaf damaged.&nbsp; Full of
buds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb&rsquo;s dull eye brightened, as he took it, and thanked
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear, Caleb,&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
dear at this season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind that.&nbsp; It would be cheap to me,
whatever it cost,&rsquo; returned the little man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anything else, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A small box,&rsquo; replied the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;For Caleb Plummer,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the little
man, spelling out the direction.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;With
Cash.&rdquo;&nbsp; With Cash, John?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With Care,&rsquo; returned the Carrier, looking over
his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where do you make out cash?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; To be sure!&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; With care!&nbsp; Yes, yes;
that&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; It might have been with cash, indeed, if
my dear Boy in the Golden South Americas had lived, John.&nbsp;
You loved him like a son; didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t say you did.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know, of course.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Caleb Plummer.&nbsp; With care.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, yes,
it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a box of dolls&rsquo; eyes
for my daughter&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I wish it was her own sight
in a box, John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it was, or could be!&rsquo; cried the
Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee,&rsquo; said the little man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You speak very hearty.&nbsp; To think that she should
never see the Dolls&mdash;and them a-staring at her, so bold, all
day long!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where it cuts.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the damage, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll damage you,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;if you
inquire.&nbsp; Dot!&nbsp; Very near?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! it&rsquo;s like you to say so,&rsquo; observed
the little man.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your kind way.&nbsp; Let
me see.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Try
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something for our Governor, eh?&rsquo; said Caleb,
after pondering a little while.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be sure.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I came for; but my head&rsquo;s so running on
them Arks and things!&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t been here, has
he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he,&rsquo; returned the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s too busy, courting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s coming round though,&rsquo; said Caleb;
&lsquo;for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going
home, and it was ten to one he&rsquo;d take me up.&nbsp; I had
better go, by the bye.&mdash;You couldn&rsquo;t have the goodness
to let me pinch Boxer&rsquo;s tail, Mum, for half a moment, could
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Caleb! what a question!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh never mind, Mum,&rsquo; said the little man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He mightn&rsquo;t like it perhaps.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a
small order just come in, for barking dogs; and I should wish to
go as close to Natur&rsquo; as I could, for sixpence.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Never mind, Mum.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It happened opportunely, that Boxer, without receiving the
proposed stimulus, began to bark with great zeal.&nbsp; But, as
this implied the approach of some new visitor, Caleb, postponing
his study from the life to a more convenient season, shouldered
the round box, and took a hurried leave.&nbsp; He might have
spared himself the trouble, for he met the visitor upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; You are here, are you?&nbsp; Wait a
bit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take you home.&nbsp; John Peerybingle, my
service to you.&nbsp; More of my service to your pretty
wife.&nbsp; Handsomer every day!&nbsp; Better too, if
possible!&nbsp; And younger,&rsquo; mused the speaker, in a low
voice; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the Devil of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be astonished at your paying compliments, Mr.
Tackleton,&rsquo; said Dot, not with the best grace in the world;
&lsquo;but for your condition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know all about it then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got myself to believe it, somehow,&rsquo; said
Dot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After a hard struggle, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tackleton the Toy-merchant, pretty generally known as Gruff
and Tackleton&mdash;for that was the firm, though Gruff had been
bought out long ago; only leaving his name, and as some said his
nature, according to its Dictionary meaning, in the
business&mdash;Tackleton the Toy-merchant, was a man whose
vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and
Guardians.&nbsp; If they had made him a Money Lender, or a sharp
Attorney, or a Sheriff&rsquo;s Officer, or a Broker, he might
have sown his discontented oats in his youth, and, after having
had the full run of himself in ill-natured transactions, might
have turned out amiable, at last, for the sake of a little
freshness and novelty.&nbsp; But, cramped and chafing in the
peaceable pursuit of toy-making, he was a domestic Ogre, who had
been living on children all his life, and was their implacable
enemy.&nbsp; He despised all toys; wouldn&rsquo;t have bought one
for the world; delighted, in his malice, to insinuate grim
expressions into the faces of brown-paper farmers who drove pigs
to market, bellmen who advertised lost lawyers&rsquo;
consciences, movable old ladies who darned stockings or carved
pies; and other like samples of his stock in trade.&nbsp; In
appalling masks; hideous, hairy, red-eyed Jacks in Boxes; Vampire
Kites; demoniacal Tumblers who wouldn&rsquo;t lie down, and were
perpetually flying forward, to stare infants out of countenance;
his soul perfectly revelled.&nbsp; They were his only relief, and
safety-valve.&nbsp; He was great in such inventions.&nbsp;
Anything suggestive of a Pony-nightmare was delicious to
him.&nbsp; He had even lost money (and he took to that toy very
kindly) by getting up Goblin slides for magic-lanterns, whereon
the Powers of Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural
shell-fish, with human faces.&nbsp; In intensifying the
portraiture of Giants, he had sunk quite a little capital; and,
though no painter himself, he could indicate, for the instruction
of his artists, with a piece of chalk, a certain furtive leer for
the countenances of those monsters, which was safe to destroy the
peace of mind of any young gentleman between the ages of six and
eleven, for the whole Christmas or Midsummer Vacation.</p>
<p>What he was in toys, he was (as most men are) in other
things.&nbsp; You may easily suppose, therefore, that within the
great green cape, which reached down to the calves of his legs,
there was buttoned up to the chin an uncommonly pleasant fellow;
and that he was about as choice a spirit, and as agreeable a
companion, as ever stood in a pair of bull-headed-looking boots
with mahogany-coloured tops.</p>
<p>Still, Tackleton, the toy-merchant, was going to be
married.&nbsp; In spite of all this, he was going to be
married.&nbsp; And to a young wife too, a beautiful young
wife.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t look much like a bridegroom, as he stood in
the Carrier&rsquo;s kitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a
screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge of his
nose, and his hands tucked down into the bottoms of his pockets,
and his whole sarcastic ill-conditioned self peering out of one
little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of
any number of ravens.&nbsp; But, a Bridegroom he designed to
be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In three days&rsquo; time.&nbsp; Next Thursday.&nbsp;
The last day of the first month in the year.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
my wedding-day,&rsquo; said Tackleton.</p>
<p>Did I mention that he had always one eye wide open, and one
eye nearly shut; and that the one eye nearly shut, was always the
expressive eye?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I did.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s my wedding-day!&rsquo; said Tackleton,
rattling his money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s our wedding-day too,&rsquo; exclaimed
the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha ha!&rsquo; laughed Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Odd!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re just such another couple.&nbsp;
Just!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The indignation of Dot at this presumptuous assertion is not
to be described.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; His imagination would
compass the possibility of just such another Baby, perhaps.&nbsp;
The man was mad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say!&nbsp; A word with you,&rsquo; murmured
Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with his elbow, and taking him a
little apart.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll come to the
wedding?&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in the same boat, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How in the same boat?&rsquo; inquired the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little disparity, you know,&rsquo; said Tackleton,
with another nudge.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come and spend an evening with
us, beforehand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; demanded John, astonished at this pressing
hospitality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; returned the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a new way of receiving an invitation.&nbsp;
Why, for pleasure&mdash;sociability, you know, and all
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you were never sociable,&rsquo; said John, in
his plain way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tchah!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of no use to be anything but
free with you, I see,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
then, the truth is you have a&mdash;what tea-drinking people call
a sort of a comfortable appearance together, you and your
wife.&nbsp; We know better, you know, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, we don&rsquo;t know better,&rsquo; interposed
John.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you talking about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; We <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know better,
then,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll agree that
we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; As you like; what does it matter?&nbsp; I
was going to say, as you have that sort of appearance, your
company will produce a favourable effect on Mrs. Tackleton that
will be.&nbsp; And, though I don&rsquo;t think your good
lady&rsquo;s very friendly to me, in this matter, still she
can&rsquo;t help herself from falling into my views, for
there&rsquo;s a compactness and cosiness of appearance about her
that always tells, even in an indifferent case.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;ll come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have arranged to keep our Wedding-Day (as far as
that goes) at home,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have made
the promise to ourselves these six months.&nbsp; We think, you
see, that home&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bah! what&rsquo;s home?&rsquo; cried Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Four walls and a ceiling! (why don&rsquo;t you kill that
Cricket?&nbsp; <i>I</i> would!&nbsp; I always do.&nbsp; I hate
their noise.)&nbsp; There are four walls and a ceiling at my
house.&nbsp; Come to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You kill your Crickets, eh?&rsquo; said John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scrunch &rsquo;em, sir,&rsquo; returned the other,
setting his heel heavily on the floor.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
say you&rsquo;ll come? It&rsquo;s as much your interest as mine,
you know, that the women should persuade each other that
they&rsquo;re quiet and contented, and couldn&rsquo;t be better
off.&nbsp; I know their way.&nbsp; Whatever one woman says,
another woman is determined to clinch, always.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s that spirit of emulation among &rsquo;em, sir, that
if your wife says to my wife, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the happiest woman
in the world, and mine&rsquo;s the best husband in the world, and
I dote on him,&rdquo; my wife will say the same to yours, or
more, and half believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say she don&rsquo;t, then?&rsquo; asked
the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Tackleton, with a short,
sharp laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier had some faint idea of adding, &lsquo;dote upon
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, happening to meet the half-closed eye, as
it twinkled upon him over the turned-up collar of the cape, which
was within an ace of poking it out, he felt it such an unlikely
part and parcel of anything to be doted on, that he substituted,
&lsquo;that she don&rsquo;t believe it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah you dog!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re joking,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.</p>
<p>But the Carrier, though slow to understand the full drift of
his meaning, eyed him in such a serious manner, that he was
obliged to be a little more explanatory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have the humour,&rsquo; said Tackleton: holding up
the fingers of his left hand, and tapping the forefinger, to
imply &lsquo;there I am, Tackleton to wit:&rsquo; &lsquo;I have
the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty wife:&rsquo;
here he rapped his little finger, to express the Bride; not
sparingly, but sharply; with a sense of power.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m able to gratify that humour and I do.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s my whim.&nbsp; But&mdash;now look there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to where Dot was sitting, thoughtfully, before the
fire; leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand, and watching the
bright blaze.&nbsp; The Carrier looked at her, and then at him,
and then at her, and then at him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know,&rsquo; said
Tackleton; &lsquo;and that, as I am not a man of sentiment, is
quite enough for <i>me</i>.&nbsp; But do you think there&rsquo;s
anything more in it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; observed the Carrier, &lsquo;that I
should chuck any man out of window, who said there
wasn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly so,&rsquo; returned the other with an unusual
alacrity of assent.&nbsp; &lsquo;To be sure!&nbsp; Doubtless you
would.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m certain of it.&nbsp; Good
night.&nbsp; Pleasant dreams!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable and uncertain,
in spite of himself.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t help showing it, in
his manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night, my dear friend!&rsquo; said Tackleton,
compassionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
exactly alike, in reality, I see.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t give us
to-morrow evening?&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; Next day you go out
visiting, I know.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll meet you there, and bring my
wife that is to be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll do her good.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re agreeable?&nbsp; Thank&rsquo;ee.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a loud cry from the Carrier&rsquo;s wife: a loud,
sharp, sudden cry, that made the room ring, like a glass
vessel.&nbsp; She had risen from her seat, and stood like one
transfixed by terror and surprise.&nbsp; The Stranger had
advanced towards the fire to warm himself, and stood within a
short stride of her chair.&nbsp; But quite still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dot!&rsquo; cried the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary!&nbsp;
Darling!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were all about her in a moment.&nbsp; Caleb, who had been
dozing on the cake-box, in the first imperfect recovery of his
suspended presence of mind, seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of
her head, but immediately apologised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary!&rsquo; exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in
his arms.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you ill!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Tell
me, dear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She only answered by beating her hands together, and falling
into a wild fit of laughter.&nbsp; Then, sinking from his grasp
upon the ground, she covered her face with her apron, and wept
bitterly.&nbsp; And then she laughed again, and then she cried
again, and then she said how cold it was, and suffered him to
lead her to the fire, where she sat down as before.&nbsp; The old
man standing, as before, quite still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m better, John,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m quite well now&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;John!&rsquo;&nbsp; But John was on the other side of
her.&nbsp; Why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman,
as if addressing him!&nbsp; Was her brain wandering?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a fancy, John dear&mdash;a kind of shock&mdash;a
something coming suddenly before my eyes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what it was.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite gone, quite gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; muttered
Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all round the room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wonder where it&rsquo;s gone, and what it was.&nbsp;
Humph!&nbsp; Caleb, come here!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s that with the
grey hair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; returned Caleb in a
whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never see him before, in all my life.&nbsp;
A beautiful figure for a nut-cracker; quite a new model.&nbsp;
With a screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he&rsquo;d be
lovely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not ugly enough,&rsquo; said Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or for a firebox, either,&rsquo; observed Caleb, in
deep contemplation, &lsquo;what a model!&nbsp; Unscrew his head
to put the matches in; turn him heels up&rsquo;ards for the
light; and what a firebox for a gentleman&rsquo;s mantel-shelf,
just as he stands!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not half ugly enough,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nothing in him at all!&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; Bring that
box!&nbsp; All right now, I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh quite gone! Quite gone!!&rsquo; said the little woman, waving him
hurriedly away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good night,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good
night, John Peerybingle!&nbsp; Take care how you carry that box,
Caleb.&nbsp; Let it fall, and I&rsquo;ll murder you!&nbsp; Dark
as pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh?&nbsp; Good
night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the
door; followed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head.</p>
<p>The Carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife, and
so busily engaged in soothing and tending her, that he had
scarcely been conscious of the Stranger&rsquo;s presence, until
now, when he again stood there, their only guest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He don&rsquo;t belong to them, you see,&rsquo; said
John.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must give him a hint to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, friend,&rsquo; said the old
gentleman, advancing to him; &lsquo;the more so, as I fear your
wife has not been well; but the Attendant whom my
infirmity,&rsquo; he touched his ears and shook his head,
&lsquo;renders almost indispensable, not having arrived, I fear
there must be some mistake.&nbsp; The bad night which made the
shelter of your comfortable cart (may I never have a worse!) so
acceptable, is still as bad as ever.&nbsp; Would you, in your
kindness, suffer me to rent a bed here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; cried Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes!&nbsp;
Certainly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity
of this consent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t object; but, still I&rsquo;m
not quite sure that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; she interrupted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
John!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he&rsquo;s stone deaf,&rsquo; urged John.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know he is, but&mdash;Yes, sir, certainly.&nbsp; Yes!
certainly!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make him up a bed, directly,
John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits, and
the agitation of her manner, were so strange that the Carrier
stood looking after her, quite confounded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did its mothers make it up a Beds then!&rsquo; cried
Miss Slowboy to the Baby; &lsquo;and did its hair grow brown and
curly, when its caps was lifted off, and frighten it, a precious
Pets, a-sitting by the fires!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles,
which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion, the
Carrier as he walked slowly to and fro, found himself mentally
repeating even these absurd words, many times.&nbsp; So many
times that he got them by heart, and was still conning them over
and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after administering as much
friction to the little bald head with her hand as she thought
wholesome (according to the practice of nurses), had once more
tied the Baby&rsquo;s cap on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the
fires.&nbsp; What frightened Dot, I wonder!&rsquo; mused the
Carrier, pacing to and fro.</p>
<p>He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the
Toy-merchant, and yet they filled him with a vague, indefinite
uneasiness.&nbsp; For, Tackleton was quick and sly; and he had
that painful sense, himself, of being a man of slow perception, that a
broken hint was always worrying to him.&nbsp; He certainly had no
intention in his mind of linking anything that Tackleton had
said, with the unusual conduct of his wife, but the two subjects
of reflection came into his mind together, and he could not keep
them asunder.</p>
<p>The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, declining all
refreshment but a cup of tea, retired.&nbsp; Then,
Dot&mdash;quite well again, she said, quite well
again&mdash;arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for
her husband; filled his pipe and gave it him; and took her usual
little stool beside him on the hearth.</p>
<p>She always <i>would</i> sit on that little stool.&nbsp; I
think she must have had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing,
wheedling little stool.</p>
<p>She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe, I should
say, in the four quarters of the globe.&nbsp; To see her put that
chubby little finger in the bowl, and then blow down the pipe to
clear the tube, and, when she had done so, affect to think that
there was really something in the tube, and blow a dozen times,
and hold it to her eye like a telescope, with a most provoking
twist in her capital little face, as she looked down it, was
quite a brilliant thing.&nbsp; As to the tobacco, she was perfect
mistress of the subject; and her lighting of the pipe, with a
wisp of paper, when the Carrier had it in his mouth&mdash;going
so very near his nose, and yet not scorching it&mdash;was Art,
high Art.</p>
<p>And the Cricket and the kettle, turning up again, acknowledged
it!&nbsp; The bright fire, blazing up again, acknowledged
it!&nbsp; The little Mower on the clock, in his unheeded work,
acknowledged it!&nbsp; The Carrier, in his smoothing forehead and
expanding face, acknowledged it, the readiest of all.</p>
<p>And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe, and
as the Dutch clock ticked, and as the red fire gleamed, and as
the Cricket chirped; that Genius of his Hearth and Home (for such
the Cricket was) came out, in fairy shape, into the room, and
summoned many forms of Home about him.&nbsp; Dots of all ages,
and all sizes, filled the chamber.&nbsp; Dots who were merry
children, running on before him gathering flowers, in the fields;
coy Dots, half shrinking from, half yielding to, the pleading of
his own rough image; newly-married Dots, alighting at the door,
and taking wondering possession of the household keys; motherly
little Dots, attended by fictitious Slowboys, bearing babies to
be christened; matronly Dots, still young and blooming, watching
Dots of daughters, as they danced at rustic balls; fat Dots,
encircled and beset by troops of rosy grandchildren; withered
Dots, who leaned on sticks, and tottered as they crept
along.&nbsp; Old Carriers too, appeared, with blind old Boxers
lying at their feet; and newer carts with younger drivers
(&lsquo;Peerybingle Brothers&rsquo; on the tilt); and sick old
Carriers, tended by the gentlest hands; and graves of dead and
gone old Carriers, green in the churchyard.&nbsp; And as the
Cricket showed him all these things&mdash;he saw them plainly,
though his eyes were fixed upon the fire&mdash;the
Carrier&rsquo;s heart grew light and happy, and he thanked his
Household Gods with all his might, and cared no more for Gruff
and Tackleton than you do.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But, what was that young figure of a man, which the same Fairy
Cricket set so near Her stool, and which remained there, singly
and alone?&nbsp; Why did it linger still, so near her, with its
arm upon the chimney-piece, ever repeating &lsquo;Married! and
not to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>O Dot!&nbsp; O failing Dot!&nbsp; There is no place for it in
all your husband&rsquo;s visions; why has its shadow fallen on
his hearth!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;Chirp the Second</h2>
<p>Caleb Plummer and his Blind Daughter lived all alone by
themselves, as the Story-books say&mdash;and my blessing, with
yours to back it I hope, on the Story-books, for saying anything
in this workaday world!&mdash;Caleb Plummer and his Blind
Daughter lived all alone by themselves, in a little cracked
nutshell of a wooden house, which was, in truth, no better than a
pimple on the prominent red-brick nose of Gruff and
Tackleton.&nbsp; The premises of Gruff and Tackleton were the
great feature of the street; but you might have knocked down
Caleb Plummer&rsquo;s dwelling with a hammer or two, and carried
off the pieces in a cart.</p>
<p>If any one had done the dwelling-house of Caleb Plummer the
honour to miss it after such an inroad, it would have been, no
doubt, to commend its demolition as a vast improvement.&nbsp; It
stuck to the premises of Gruff and Tackleton, like a barnacle to
a ship&rsquo;s keel, or a snail to a door, or a little bunch of
toadstools to the stem of a tree.</p>
<p>But, it was the germ from which the full-grown trunk of Gruff
and Tackleton had sprung; and, under its crazy roof, the Gruff
before last, had, in a small way, made toys for a generation of
old boys and girls, who had played with them, and found them out,
and broken them, and gone to sleep.</p>
<p>I have said that Caleb and his poor Blind Daughter lived
here.&nbsp; I should have said that Caleb lived here, and his
poor Blind Daughter somewhere else&mdash;in an enchanted home of
Caleb&rsquo;s furnishing, where scarcity and shabbiness were not,
and trouble never entered.&nbsp; Caleb was no sorcerer, but in
the only magic art that still remains to us, the magic of
devoted, deathless love, Nature had been the mistress of his
study; and from her teaching, all the wonder came.</p>
<p>The Blind Girl never knew that ceilings were discoloured,
walls blotched and bare of plaster here and there, high crevices
unstopped and widening every day, beams mouldering and tending
downward.&nbsp; The Blind Girl never knew that iron was rusting,
wood rotting, paper peeling off; the size, and shape, and true
proportion of the dwelling, withering away.&nbsp; The Blind Girl
never knew that ugly shapes of delf and earthenware were on the
board; that sorrow and faintheartedness were in the house; that
Caleb&rsquo;s scanty hairs were turning greyer and more grey,
before her sightless face.&nbsp; The Blind Girl never knew they
had a master, cold, exacting, and uninterested&mdash;never knew
that Tackleton was Tackleton in short; but lived in the belief of
an eccentric humourist who loved to have his jest with them, and
who, while he was the Guardian Angel of their lives, disdained to
hear one word of thankfulness.</p>
<p>And all was Caleb&rsquo;s doing; all the doing of her simple
father!&nbsp; But he too had a Cricket on his Hearth; and
listening sadly to its music when the motherless Blind Child was
very young, that Spirit had inspired him with the thought that
even her great deprivation might be almost changed into a
blessing, and the girl made happy by these little means.&nbsp;
For all the Cricket tribe are potent Spirits, even though the
people who hold converse with them do not know it (which is
frequently the case); and there are not in the unseen world,
voices more gentle and more true, that may be so implicitly
relied on, or that are so certain to give none but tenderest
counsel, as the Voices in which the Spirits of the Fireside and
the Hearth address themselves to human kind.</p>
<p>Caleb and his daughter were at work together in their usual
working-room, which served them for their ordinary living-room as
well; and a strange place it was.&nbsp; There were houses in it,
finished and unfinished, for Dolls of all stations in life.&nbsp;
Suburban tenements for Dolls of moderate means; kitchens and
single apartments for Dolls of the lower classes; capital town
residences for Dolls of high estate.&nbsp; Some of these
establishments were already furnished according to estimate, with
a view to the convenience of Dolls of limited income; others
could be fitted on the most expensive scale, at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, from whole shelves of chairs and tables, sofas,
bedsteads, and upholstery.&nbsp; The nobility and gentry, and
public in general, for whose accommodation these tenements were
designed, lay, here and there, in baskets, staring straight up at
the ceiling; but, in denoting their degrees in society, and
confining them to their respective stations (which experience
shows to be lamentably difficult in real life), the makers of
these Dolls had far improved on Nature, who is often froward and
perverse; for, they, not resting on such arbitrary marks as
satin, cotton-print, and bits of rag, had superadded striking
personal differences which allowed of no mistake.&nbsp; Thus, the
Doll-lady of distinction had wax limbs of perfect symmetry; but
only she and her compeers.&nbsp; The next grade in the social
scale being made of leather, and the next of coarse linen
stuff.&nbsp; As to the common-people, they had just so many
matches out of tinder-boxes, for their arms and legs, and there
they were&mdash;established in their sphere at once, beyond the
possibility of getting out of it.</p>
<p>There were various other samples of his handicraft, besides
Dolls, in Caleb Plummer&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; There were
Noah&rsquo;s Arks, in which the Birds and Beasts were an
uncommonly tight fit, I assure you; though they could be crammed
in, anyhow, at the roof, and rattled and shaken into the smallest
compass.&nbsp; By a bold poetical licence, most of these
Noah&rsquo;s Arks had knockers on the doors; inconsistent
appendages, perhaps, as suggestive of morning callers and a
Postman, yet a pleasant finish to the outside of the
building.&nbsp; There were scores of melancholy little carts,
which, when the wheels went round, performed most doleful
music.&nbsp; Many small fiddles, drums, and other instruments of
torture; no end of cannon, shields, swords, spears, and
guns.&nbsp; There were little tumblers in red breeches,
incessantly swarming up high obstacles of red-tape, and coming
down, head first, on the other side; and there were innumerable
old gentlemen of respectable, not to say venerable, appearance,
insanely flying over horizontal pegs, inserted, for the purpose,
in their own street doors.&nbsp; There were beasts of all sorts;
horses, in particular, of every breed, from the spotted barrel on
four pegs, with a small tippet for a mane, to the thoroughbred
rocker on his highest mettle.&nbsp; As it would have been hard to
count the dozens upon dozens of grotesque figures that were ever
ready to commit all sorts of absurdities on the turning of a
handle, so it would have been no easy task to mention any human
folly, vice, or weakness, that had not its type, immediate or
remote, in Caleb Plummer&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; And not in an
exaggerated form, for very little handles will move men and women
to as strange performances, as any Toy was ever made to
undertake.</p>
<p>In the midst of all these objects, Caleb and his daughter sat
at work.&nbsp; The Blind Girl busy as a Doll&rsquo;s dressmaker;
Caleb painting and glazing the four-pair front of a desirable
family mansion.</p>
<p>The care imprinted in the lines of Caleb&rsquo;s face, and his
absorbed and dreamy manner, which would have sat well on some
alchemist or abstruse student, were at first sight an odd
contrast to his occupation, and the trivialities about him.&nbsp;
But, trivial things, invented and pursued for bread, become very
serious matters of fact; and, apart from this consideration, I am
not at all prepared to say, myself, that if Caleb had been a Lord
Chamberlain, or a Member of Parliament, or a lawyer, or even a
great speculator, he would have dealt in toys one whit less
whimsical, while I have a very great doubt whether they would
have been as harmless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you were out in the rain last night, father, in your
beautiful new great-coat,&rsquo; said Caleb&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my beautiful new great-coat,&rsquo; answered Caleb,
glancing towards a clothes-line in the room, on which the
sack-cloth garment previously described, was carefully hung up to
dry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How glad I am you bought it, father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of such a tailor, too,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Quite a fashionable tailor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too good for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl rested from her work, and laughed with
delight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too good, father!&nbsp; What can be too good for
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m half-ashamed to wear it though,&rsquo; said
Caleb, watching the effect of what he said, upon her brightening
face; &lsquo;upon my word!&nbsp; When I hear the boys and people
say behind me, &ldquo;Hal-loa!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
swell!&rdquo;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know which way to look.&nbsp;
And when the beggar wouldn&rsquo;t go away last night; and when I
said I was a very common man, said &ldquo;No, your Honour!&nbsp;
Bless your Honour, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was quite
ashamed.&nbsp; I really felt as if I hadn&rsquo;t a right to wear
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Happy Blind Girl!&nbsp; How merry she was, in her
exultation!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see you, father,&rsquo; she said, clasping her hands,
&lsquo;as plainly, as if I had the eyes I never want when you are
with me.&nbsp; A blue coat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bright blue,&rsquo; said Caleb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes!&nbsp; Bright blue!&rsquo; exclaimed the girl,
turning up her radiant face; &lsquo;the colour I can just
remember in the blessed sky!&nbsp; You told me it was blue
before!&nbsp; A bright blue coat&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Made loose to the figure,&rsquo; suggested Caleb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Made loose to the figure!&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl,
laughing heartily; &lsquo;and in it, you, dear father, with your
merry eye, your smiling face, your free step, and your dark
hair&mdash;looking so young and handsome!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Halloa!&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall be vain, presently!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are, already,&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl,
pointing at him, in her glee.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you,
father!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found you out, you
see!&rsquo;</p>
<p>How different the picture in her mind, from Caleb, as he sat
observing her!&nbsp; She had spoken of his free step.&nbsp; She
was right in that.&nbsp; For years and years, he had never once
crossed that threshold at his own slow pace, but with a footfall
counterfeited for her ear; and never had he, when his heart was
heaviest, forgotten the light tread that was to render hers so
cheerful and courageous!</p>
<p>Heaven knows!&nbsp; But I think Caleb&rsquo;s vague
bewilderment of manner may have half originated in his having
confused himself about himself and everything around him, for the
love of his Blind Daughter.&nbsp; How could the little man be
otherwise than bewildered, after labouring for so many years to
destroy his own identity, and that of all the objects that had
any bearing on it!</p>
<p>&lsquo;There we are,&rsquo; said Caleb, falling back a pace or
two to form the better judgment of his work; &lsquo;as near the
real thing as sixpenn&rsquo;orth of halfpence is to
sixpence.&nbsp; What a pity that the whole front of the house
opens at once!&nbsp; If there was only a staircase in it, now,
and regular doors to the rooms to go in at!&nbsp; But
that&rsquo;s the worst of my calling, I&rsquo;m always deluding
myself, and swindling myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are speaking quite softly.&nbsp; You are not tired,
father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tired!&rsquo; echoed Caleb, with a great burst of
animation, &lsquo;what should tire me, Bertha?&nbsp; <i>I</i> was
never tired.&nbsp; What does it mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>To give the greater force to his words, he checked himself in
an involuntary imitation of two half-length stretching and
yawning figures on the mantel-shelf, who were represented as in
one eternal state of weariness from the waist upwards; and hummed
a fragment of a song.&nbsp; It was a Bacchanalian song, something
about a Sparkling Bowl.&nbsp; He sang it with an assumption of a
Devil-may-care voice, that made his face a thousand times more
meagre and more thoughtful than ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re singing, are you?&rsquo; said
Tackleton, putting his head in at the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go
it!&nbsp; <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nobody would have suspected him of it.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t
what is generally termed a singing face, by any means.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to sing,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad <i>you can</i>.&nbsp; I
hope you can afford to work too.&nbsp; Hardly time for both, I
should think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you could only see him, Bertha, how he&rsquo;s
winking at me!&rsquo; whispered Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such a man to
joke! you&rsquo;d think, if you didn&rsquo;t know him, he was in
earnest&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bird that can sing and won&rsquo;t sing, must be
made to sing, they say,&rsquo; grumbled Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What about the owl that can&rsquo;t sing, and
oughtn&rsquo;t to sing, and will sing; is there anything that
<i>he</i> should be made to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The extent to which he&rsquo;s winking at this
moment!&rsquo; whispered Caleb to his daughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
my gracious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Always merry and light-hearted with us!&rsquo; cried
the smiling Bertha.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, you&rsquo;re there, are you?&rsquo; answered
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor Idiot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He really did believe she was an Idiot; and he founded the
belief, I can&rsquo;t say whether consciously or not, upon her
being fond of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! and being there,&mdash;how are you?&rsquo; said
Tackleton, in his grudging way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! well; quite well.&nbsp; And as happy as even you
can wish me to be.&nbsp; As happy as you would make the whole
world, if you could!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Idiot!&rsquo; muttered Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
gleam of reason.&nbsp; Not a gleam!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl took his hand and kissed it; held it for a
moment in her own two hands; and laid her cheek against it
tenderly, before releasing it.&nbsp; There was such unspeakable
affection and such fervent gratitude in the act, that Tackleton
himself was moved to say, in a milder growl than usual:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I stood it close beside my pillow when I went to sleep
last night, and remembered it in my dreams.&nbsp; And when the
day broke, and the glorious red sun&mdash;the <i>red</i> sun,
father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Red in the mornings and the evenings, Bertha,&rsquo;
said poor Caleb, with a woeful glance at his employer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When it rose, and the bright light I almost fear to
strike myself against in walking, came into the room, I turned
the little tree towards it, and blessed Heaven for making things
so precious, and blessed you for sending them to cheer
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bedlam broke loose!&rsquo; said Tackleton under his
breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall arrive at the strait-waistcoat and
mufflers soon.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re getting on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb, with his hands hooked loosely in each other, stared
vacantly before him while his daughter spoke, as if he really
were uncertain (I believe he was) whether Tackleton had done
anything to deserve her thanks, or not.&nbsp; If he could have
been a perfectly free agent, at that moment, required, on pain of
death, to kick the Toy-merchant, or fall at his feet, according
to his merits, I believe it would have been an even chance which
course he would have taken.&nbsp; Yet, Caleb knew that with his
own hands he had brought the little rose-tree home for her, so
carefully, and that with his own lips he had forged the innocent
deception which should help to keep her from suspecting how much,
how very much, he every day, denied himself, that she might be
the happier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha!&rsquo; said Tackleton, assuming, for the nonce,
a little cordiality.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I can come straight to you!&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t guide me!&rsquo; she rejoined.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will!&rsquo; she answered, eagerly.</p>
<p>How bright the darkened face!&nbsp; How adorned with light,
the listening head!</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the day on which little what&rsquo;s-her-name,
the spoilt child, Peerybingle&rsquo;s wife, pays her regular
visit to you&mdash;makes her fantastic Pic-Nic here; an&rsquo;t
it?&rsquo; said Tackleton, with a strong expression of distaste
for the whole concern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is the
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
should like to join the party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you hear that, father!&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl
in an ecstasy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, I hear it,&rsquo; murmured Caleb, with the
fixed look of a sleep-walker; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s one of my lies, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see I&mdash;I want to bring the Peerybingles a
little more into company with May Fielding,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going to be married to
May.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married!&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl, starting from
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s such a con-founded Idiot,&rsquo; muttered
Tackleton, &lsquo;that I was afraid she&rsquo;d never comprehend
me.&nbsp; Ah, Bertha!&nbsp; Married!&nbsp; Church, parson, clerk,
beadle, glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake, favours,
marrow-bones, cleavers, and all the rest of the tom-foolery.&nbsp;
A wedding, you know; a wedding.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know what a
wedding is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; replied the Blind Girl, in a gentle
tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;I understand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you?&rsquo; muttered Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s more than I expected.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; On that
account I want to join the party, and to bring May and her
mother.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send in a little something or other,
before the afternoon.&nbsp; A cold leg of mutton, or some
comfortable trifle of that sort.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll expect
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p>She had drooped her head, and turned away; and so stood, with
her hands crossed, musing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will,&rsquo; muttered
Tackleton, looking at her; &lsquo;for you seem to have forgotten
all about it, already.&nbsp; Caleb!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may venture to say I&rsquo;m here, I suppose,&rsquo;
thought Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care she don&rsquo;t forget what I&rsquo;ve been
saying to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>She</i> never forgets,&rsquo; returned Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s one of the few things she an&rsquo;t clever
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every man thinks his own geese swans,&rsquo; observed
the Toy-merchant, with a shrug.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
devil!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered himself of which remark, with infinite
contempt, old Gruff and Tackleton withdrew.</p>
<p>Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in
meditation.&nbsp; The gaiety had vanished from her downcast face,
and it was very sad.&nbsp; Three or four times she shook her
head, as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss; but her
sorrowful reflections found no vent in words.</p>
<p>It was not until Caleb had been occupied, some time, in yoking
a team of horses to a waggon by the summary process of nailing
the harness to the vital parts of their bodies, that she drew
near to his working-stool, and sitting down beside him, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father, I am lonely in the dark.&nbsp; I want my eyes,
my patient, willing eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they are,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Always
ready.&nbsp; They are more yours than mine, Bertha, any hour in
the four-and-twenty.&nbsp; What shall your eyes do for you,
dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look round the room, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;No sooner
said than done, Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s much the same as usual,&rsquo; said
Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Homely, but very snug.&nbsp; The gay colours
on the walls; the bright flowers on the plates and dishes; the
shining wood, where there are beams or panels; the general
cheerfulness and neatness of the building; make it very
pretty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cheerful and neat it was wherever Bertha&rsquo;s hands could
busy themselves.&nbsp; But nowhere else, were cheerfulness and
neatness possible, in the old crazy shed which Caleb&rsquo;s
fancy so transformed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have your working dress on, and are not so gallant
as when you wear the handsome coat?&rsquo; said Bertha, touching
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite so gallant,&rsquo; answered Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pretty brisk though.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said the Blind Girl, drawing close to
his side, and stealing one arm round his neck, &lsquo;tell me
something about May.&nbsp; She is very fair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is indeed,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp; And she was
indeed.&nbsp; It was quite a rare thing to Caleb, not to have to
draw on his invention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her hair is dark,&rsquo; said Bertha, pensively,
&lsquo;darker than mine.&nbsp; Her voice is sweet and musical, I
know.&nbsp; I have often loved to hear it.&nbsp; Her
shape&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a Doll&rsquo;s in all the room to
equal it,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;And her
eyes!&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped; for Bertha had drawn closer round his neck, and
from the arm that clung about him, came a warning pressure which
he understood too well.</p>
<p>He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment, and then fell back
upon the song about the sparkling bowl; his infallible resource
in all such difficulties.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our friend, father, our benefactor.&nbsp; I am never
tired, you know, of hearing about him.&mdash;Now, was I
ever?&rsquo; she said, hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; answered Caleb, &lsquo;and with
reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; With how much reason!&rsquo; cried the Blind
Girl.&nbsp; With such fervency, that Caleb, though his motives
were so pure, could not endure to meet her face; but dropped his
eyes, as if she could have read in them his innocent deceit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, tell me again about him, dear father,&rsquo; said
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many times again!&nbsp; His face is
benevolent, kind, and tender.&nbsp; Honest and true, I am sure it
is.&nbsp; The manly heart that tries to cloak all favours with a
show of roughness and unwillingness, beats in its every look and
glance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And makes it noble!&rsquo; added Caleb, in his quiet
desperation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And makes it noble!&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is older than May, father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye-es,&rsquo; said Caleb, reluctantly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a little older than May.&nbsp; But that
don&rsquo;t signify.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh father, yes!&nbsp; To be his patient companion in
infirmity and age; to be his gentle nurse in sickness, and his
constant friend in suffering and sorrow; to know no weariness in
working for his sake; to watch him, tend him, sit beside his bed
and talk to him awake, and pray for him asleep; what privileges
these would be!&nbsp; What opportunities for proving all her
truth and devotion to him!&nbsp; Would she do all this, dear
father?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt of it,&rsquo; said Caleb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love her, father; I can love her from my soul!&rsquo;
exclaimed the Blind Girl.&nbsp; And saying so, she laid her poor
blind face on Caleb&rsquo;s shoulder, and so wept and wept, that
he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful happiness upon
her.</p>
<p>In the mean time, there had been a pretty sharp commotion at
John Peerybingle&rsquo;s, for little Mrs. Peerybingle naturally
couldn&rsquo;t think of going anywhere without the Baby; and to
get the Baby under weigh took time.&nbsp; Not that there was much
of the Baby, speaking of it as a thing of weight and measure, but
there was a vast deal to do about and about it, and it all had to
be done by easy stages.&nbsp; For instance, when the Baby was
got, by hook and by crook, to a certain point of dressing, and
you might have rationally supposed that another touch or two
would finish him off, and turn him out a tip-top Baby challenging
the world, he was unexpectedly extinguished in a flannel cap, and
hustled off to bed; where he simmered (so to speak) between two
blankets for the best part of an hour.&nbsp; From this state of
inaction he was then recalled, shining very much and roaring
violently, to partake of&mdash;well?&nbsp; I would rather say, if
you&rsquo;ll permit me to speak generally&mdash;of a slight
repast.&nbsp; After which, he went to sleep again.&nbsp; Mrs.
Peerybingle took advantage of this interval, to make herself as
smart in a small way as ever you saw anybody in all your life;
and, during the same short truce, Miss Slowboy insinuated herself
into a spencer of a fashion so surprising and ingenious, that it
had no connection with herself, or anything else in the universe,
but was a shrunken, dog&rsquo;s-eared, independent fact, pursuing
its lonely course without the least regard to anybody.&nbsp; By
this time, the Baby, being all alive again, was invested, by the
united efforts of Mrs. Peerybingle and Miss Slowboy, with a
cream-coloured mantle for its body, and a sort of nankeen
raised-pie for its head; and so in course of time they all three
got down to the door, where the old horse had already taken more
than the full value of his day&rsquo;s toll out of the Turnpike
Trust, by tearing up the road with his impatient autographs; and
whence Boxer might be dimly seen in the remote perspective,
standing looking back, and tempting him to come on without
orders.</p>
<p>As to a chair, or anything of that kind for helping Mrs.
Peerybingle into the cart, you know very little of John, if you
think <i>that</i> was necessary.&nbsp; Before you could have seen
him lift her from the ground, there she was in her place, fresh
and rosy, saying, &lsquo;John!&nbsp; How <i>can</i> you!&nbsp;
Think of Tilly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>If I might be allowed to mention a young lady&rsquo;s legs, on
any terms, I would observe of Miss Slowboy&rsquo;s that there was
a fatality about them which rendered them singularly liable to be
grazed; and that she never effected the smallest ascent or
descent, without recording the circumstance upon them with a
notch, as Robinson Crusoe marked the days upon his wooden
calendar.&nbsp; But as this might be considered ungenteel,
I&rsquo;ll think of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got the Basket with the Veal
and Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer?&rsquo; said
Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you haven&rsquo;t, you must turn round
again, this very minute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a nice little article,&rsquo; returned the
Carrier, &lsquo;to be talking about turning round, after keeping
me a full quarter of an hour behind my time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for it, John,&rsquo; said Dot in a great
bustle, &lsquo;but I really could not think of going to
Bertha&rsquo;s&mdash;I would not do it, John, on any
account&mdash;without the Veal and Ham-Pie and things, and the
bottles of Beer.&nbsp; Way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This monosyllable was addressed to the horse, who didn&rsquo;t
mind it at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh <i>do</i> way, John!&rsquo; said Mrs.
Peerybingle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be time enough to do that,&rsquo; returned
John, &lsquo;when I begin to leave things behind me.&nbsp; The
basket&rsquo;s here, safe enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a hard-hearted monster you must be, John, not to
have said so, at once, and save me such a turn!&nbsp; I declared
I wouldn&rsquo;t go to Bertha&rsquo;s without the Veal and
Ham-Pie and things, and the bottles of Beer, for any money.&nbsp;
Regularly once a fortnight ever since we have been married, John,
have we made our little Pic-Nic there.&nbsp; If anything was to
go wrong with it, I should almost think we were never to be lucky
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a kind thought in the first instance,&rsquo;
said the Carrier: &lsquo;and I honour you for it, little
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear John,&rsquo; replied Dot, turning very red,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk about honouring <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Good
Gracious!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the bye&mdash;&rsquo; observed the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That old gentleman&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again so visibly, and instantly embarrassed!</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s an odd fish,&rsquo; said the Carrier,
looking straight along the road before them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t make him out.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s any harm in him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None at all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure
there&rsquo;s none at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Carrier, with his eyes attracted
to her face by the great earnestness of her manner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am glad you feel so certain of it, because it&rsquo;s a
confirmation to me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s curious that he should have
taken it into his head to ask leave to go on lodging with us;
an&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Things come about so strangely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So very strangely,&rsquo; she rejoined in a low voice,
scarcely audible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, he&rsquo;s a good-natured old
gentleman,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;and pays as a gentleman, and
I think his word is to be relied upon, like a
gentleman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I had quite a long talk with him this
morning: he can hear me better already, he says, as he gets more
used to my voice.&nbsp; He told me a great deal about himself,
and I told him a great deal about myself, and a rare lot of
questions he asked me.&nbsp; I gave him information about my
having two beats, you know, in my business; one day to the right
from our house and back again; another day to the left from our
house and back again (for he&rsquo;s a stranger and don&rsquo;t
know the names of places about here); and he seemed quite
pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, then I shall be returning home
to-night your way,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;when I thought
you&rsquo;d be coming in an exactly opposite direction.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s capital!&nbsp; I may trouble you for another lift
perhaps, but I&rsquo;ll engage not to fall so sound asleep
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <i>was</i> sound asleep,
sure-ly!&mdash;Dot! what are you thinking of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thinking of, John?&nbsp; I&mdash;I was listening to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo; said the honest
Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was afraid, from the look of your face,
that I had gone rambling on so long, as to set you thinking about
something else.&nbsp; I was very near it, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dot making no reply, they jogged on, for some little time, in
silence.&nbsp; But, it was not easy to remain silent very long in
John Peerybingle&rsquo;s cart, for everybody on the road had
something to say.&nbsp; Though it might only be &lsquo;How are
you!&rsquo; and indeed it was very often nothing else, still, to
give that back again in the right spirit of cordiality, required,
not merely a nod and a smile, but as wholesome an action of the
lungs withal, as a long-winded Parliamentary speech.&nbsp;
Sometimes, passengers on foot, or horseback, plodded on a little
way beside the cart, for the express purpose of having a chat;
and then there was a great deal to be said, on both sides.</p>
<p>Then, Boxer gave occasion to more good-natured recognitions
of, and by, the Carrier, than half-a-dozen Christians could have
done!&nbsp; Everybody knew him, all along the
road&mdash;especially the fowls and pigs, who when they saw him
approaching, with his body all on one side, and his ears pricked
up inquisitively, and that knob of a tail making the most of
itself in the air, immediately withdrew into remote back
settlements, without waiting for the honour of a nearer
acquaintance.&nbsp; He had business everywhere; going down all
the turnings, looking into all the wells, bolting in and out of
all the cottages, dashing into the midst of all the Dame-Schools,
fluttering all the pigeons, magnifying the tails of all the cats,
and trotting into the public-houses like a regular
customer.&nbsp; Wherever he went, somebody or other might have
been heard to cry, &lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Boxer!&rsquo; and out came that somebody forthwith, accompanied
by at least two or three other somebodies, to give John
Peerybingle and his pretty wife, Good Day.</p>
<p>The packages and parcels for the errand cart, were numerous;
and there were many stoppages to take them in and give them out,
which were not by any means the worst parts of the journey.&nbsp;
Some people were so full of expectation about their parcels, and
other people were so full of wonder about their parcels, and
other people were so full of inexhaustible directions about their
parcels, and John had such a lively interest in all the parcels,
that it was as good as a play.&nbsp; Likewise, there were
articles to carry, which required to be considered and discussed,
and in reference to the adjustment and disposition of which,
councils had to be holden by the Carrier and the senders: at
which Boxer usually assisted, in short fits of the closest
attention, and long fits of tearing round and round the assembled
sages and barking himself hoarse.&nbsp; Of all these little
incidents, Dot was the amused and open-eyed spectatress from her
chair in the cart; and as she sat there, looking on&mdash;a
charming little portrait framed to admiration by the
tilt&mdash;there was no lack of nudgings and glancings and
whisperings and envyings among the younger men.&nbsp; And this
delighted John the Carrier, beyond measure; for he was proud to
have his little wife admired, knowing that she didn&rsquo;t mind
it&mdash;that, if anything, she rather liked it perhaps.</p>
<p>The trip was a little foggy, to be sure, in the January
weather; and was raw and cold.&nbsp; But who cared for such
trifles?&nbsp; Not Dot, decidedly.&nbsp; Not Tilly Slowboy, for
she deemed sitting in a cart, on any terms, to be the highest
point of human joys; the crowning circumstance of earthly
hopes.&nbsp; Not the Baby, I&rsquo;ll be sworn; for it&rsquo;s
not in Baby nature to be warmer or more sound asleep, though its
capacity is great in both respects, than that blessed young
Peerybingle was, all the way.</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t see very far in the fog, of course; but you
could see a great deal!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s astonishing how much you
may see, in a thicker fog than that, if you will only take the
trouble to look for it.&nbsp; Why, even to sit watching for the
Fairy-rings in the fields, and for the patches of hoar-frost
still lingering in the shade, near hedges and by trees, was a
pleasant occupation: to make no mention of the unexpected shapes
in which the trees themselves came starting out of the mist, and
glided into it again.&nbsp; The hedges were tangled and bare, and
waved a multitude of blighted garlands in the wind; but there was
no discouragement in this.&nbsp; It was agreeable to contemplate;
for it made the fireside warmer in possession, and the summer
greener in expectancy.&nbsp; The river looked chilly; but it was
in motion, and moving at a good pace&mdash;which was a great
point.&nbsp; The canal was rather slow and torpid; that must be
admitted.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; It would freeze the sooner when
the frost set fairly in, and then there would be skating, and
sliding; and the heavy old barges, frozen up somewhere near a
wharf, would smoke their rusty iron chimney pipes all day, and
have a lazy time of it.</p>
<p>In one place, there was a great mound of weeds or stubble
burning; and they watched the fire, so white in the daytime,
flaring through the fog, with only here and there a dash of red
in it, until, in consequence, as she observed, of the smoke
&lsquo;getting up her nose,&rsquo; Miss Slowboy choked&mdash;she
could do anything of that sort, on the smallest
provocation&mdash;and woke the Baby, who wouldn&rsquo;t go to
sleep again.&nbsp; But, Boxer, who was in advance some quarter of
a mile or so, had already passed the outposts of the town, and
gained the corner of the street where Caleb and his daughter
lived; and long before they had reached the door, he and the
Blind Girl were on the pavement waiting to receive them.</p>
<p>Boxer, by the way, made certain delicate distinctions of his
own, in his communication with Bertha, which persuade me fully
that he knew her to be blind.&nbsp; He never sought to attract
her attention by looking at her, as he often did with other
people, but touched her invariably.&nbsp; What experience he
could ever have had of blind people or blind dogs, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; He had never lived with a blind master; nor had Mr.
Boxer the elder, nor Mrs. Boxer, nor any of his respectable
family on either side, ever been visited with blindness, that I
am aware of.&nbsp; He may have found it out for himself, perhaps,
but he had got hold of it somehow; and therefore he had hold of
Bertha too, by the skirt, and kept hold, until Mrs. Peerybingle
and the Baby, and Miss Slowboy, and the basket, were all got
safely within doors.</p>
<p>May Fielding was already come; and so was her mother&mdash;a
little querulous chip of an old lady with a peevish face, who, in
right of having preserved a waist like a bedpost, was supposed to
be a most transcendent figure; and who, in consequence of having
once been better off, or of labouring under an impression that
she might have been, if something had happened which never did
happen, and seemed to have never been particularly likely to come
to pass&mdash;but it&rsquo;s all the same&mdash;was very genteel
and patronising indeed.&nbsp; Gruff and Tackleton was also there,
doing the agreeable, with the evident sensation of being as
perfectly at home, and as unquestionably in his own element, as a
fresh young salmon on the top of the Great Pyramid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May!&nbsp; My dear old friend!&rsquo; cried Dot,
running up to meet her.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a happiness to see
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as glad as she;
and it really was, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, quite a pleasant
sight to see them embrace.&nbsp; Tackleton was a man of taste
beyond all question.&nbsp; May was very pretty.</p>
<p>You know sometimes, when you are used to a pretty face, how,
when it comes into contact and comparison with another pretty
face, it seems for the moment to be homely and faded, and hardly
to deserve the high opinion you have had of it.&nbsp; Now, this
was not at all the case, either with Dot or May; for May&rsquo;s
face set off Dot&rsquo;s, and Dot&rsquo;s face set off
May&rsquo;s, so naturally and agreeably, that, as John
Peerybingle was very near saying when he came into the room, they
ought to have been born sisters&mdash;which was the only
improvement you could have suggested.</p>
<p>Tackleton had brought his leg of mutton, and, wonderful to
relate, a tart besides&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t mind a little
dissipation when our brides are in the case; we don&rsquo;t get
married every day&mdash;and in addition to these dainties, there
were the Veal and Ham-Pie, and &lsquo;things,&rsquo; as Mrs.
Peerybingle called them; which were chiefly nuts and oranges, and
cakes, and such small deer.&nbsp; When the repast was set forth
on the board, flanked by Caleb&rsquo;s contribution, which was a
great wooden bowl of smoking potatoes (he was prohibited, by
solemn compact, from producing any other viands), Tackleton led
his intended mother-in-law to the post of honour.&nbsp; For the
better gracing of this place at the high festival, the majestic
old soul had adorned herself with a cap, calculated to inspire
the thoughtless with sentiments of awe.&nbsp; She also wore her
gloves.&nbsp; But let us be genteel, or die!</p>
<p>Caleb sat next his daughter; Dot and her old schoolfellow were
side by side; the good Carrier took care of the bottom of the
table.&nbsp; Miss Slowboy was isolated, for the time being, from
every article of furniture but the chair she sat on, that she
might have nothing else to knock the Baby&rsquo;s head
against.</p>
<p>As Tilly stared about her at the dolls and toys, they stared
at her and at the company.&nbsp; The venerable old gentlemen at
the street doors (who were all in full action) showed especial
interest in the party, pausing occasionally before leaping, as if
they were listening to the conversation, and then plunging wildly
over and over, a great many times, without halting for
breath&mdash;as in a frantic state of delight with the whole
proceedings.</p>
<p>Certainly, if these old gentlemen were inclined to have a
fiendish joy in the contemplation of Tackleton&rsquo;s
discomfiture, they had good reason to be satisfied.&nbsp;
Tackleton couldn&rsquo;t get on at all; and the more cheerful his
intended bride became in Dot&rsquo;s society, the less he liked
it, though he had brought them together for that purpose.&nbsp;
For he was a regular dog in the manger, was Tackleton; and when
they laughed and he couldn&rsquo;t, he took it into his head,
immediately, that they must be laughing at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, May!&rsquo; said Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear dear, what
changes!&nbsp; To talk of those merry school-days makes one young
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you an&rsquo;t particularly old, at any time; are
you?&rsquo; said Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at my sober plodding husband there,&rsquo;
returned Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;He adds twenty years to my age at
least.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you, John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forty,&rsquo; John replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How many <i>you</i>&rsquo;ll add to May&rsquo;s, I am
sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Dot, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But she can&rsquo;t be much less than a hundred years of
age on her next birthday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha ha!&rsquo; laughed Tackleton.&nbsp; Hollow as a
drum, that laugh though.&nbsp; And he looked as if he could have
twisted Dot&rsquo;s neck, comfortably.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear dear!&rsquo; said Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only to
remember how we used to talk, at school, about the husbands we
would choose.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how young, and how
handsome, and how gay, and how lively, mine was not to be!&nbsp;
And as to May&rsquo;s!&mdash;Ah dear!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether to laugh or cry, when I think what silly girls we
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>May seemed to know which to do; for the colour flushed into
her face, and tears stood in her eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even the very persons themselves&mdash;real live young
men&mdash;were fixed on sometimes,&rsquo; said Dot.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We little thought how things would come about.&nbsp; I
never fixed on John I&rsquo;m sure; I never so much as thought of
him.&nbsp; And if I had told you, you were ever to be married to
Mr. Tackleton, why you&rsquo;d have slapped me.&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t you, May?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though May didn&rsquo;t say yes, she certainly didn&rsquo;t
say no, or express no, by any means.</p>
<p>Tackleton laughed&mdash;quite shouted, he laughed so
loud.&nbsp; John Peerybingle laughed too, in his ordinary
good-natured and contented manner; but his was a mere whisper of
a laugh, to Tackleton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t help yourselves, for all that.&nbsp;
You couldn&rsquo;t resist us, you see,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here we are!&nbsp; Here we
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are your gay young bridegrooms now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of them are dead,&rsquo; said Dot; &lsquo;and some
of them forgotten.&nbsp; Some of them, if they could stand among
us at this moment, would not believe we were the same creatures;
would not believe that what they saw and heard was real, and we
<i>could</i> forget them so.&nbsp; No! they would not believe one
word of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Dot!&rsquo; exclaimed the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Little woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had spoken with such earnestness and fire, that she stood
in need of some recalling to herself, without doubt.&nbsp; Her
husband&rsquo;s check was very gentle, for he merely interfered,
as he supposed, to shield old Tackleton; but it proved effectual,
for she stopped, and said no more.&nbsp; There was an uncommon
agitation, even in her silence, which the wary Tackleton, who had
brought his half-shut eye to bear upon her, noted closely, and
remembered to some purpose too.</p>
<p>May uttered no word, good or bad, but sat quite still, with
her eyes cast down, and made no sign of interest in what had
passed.&nbsp; The good lady her mother now interposed, observing,
in the first instance, that girls were girls, and byegones
byegones, and that so long as young people were young and
thoughtless, they would probably conduct themselves like young
and thoughtless persons: with two or three other positions of a
no less sound and incontrovertible character.&nbsp; She then
remarked, in a devout spirit, that she thanked Heaven she had
always found in her daughter May, a dutiful and obedient child;
for which she took no credit to herself, though she had every
reason to believe it was entirely owing to herself.&nbsp; With
regard to Mr. Tackleton she said, That he was in a moral point of
view an undeniable individual, and That he was in an eligible
point of view a son-in-law to be desired, no one in their senses
could doubt.&nbsp; (She was very emphatic here.)&nbsp; With
regard to the family into which he was so soon about, after some
solicitation, to be admitted, she believed Mr. Tackleton knew
that, although reduced in purse, it had some pretensions to
gentility; and if certain circumstances, not wholly unconnected,
she would go so far as to say, with the Indigo Trade, but to
which she would not more particularly refer, had happened
differently, it might perhaps have been in possession of
wealth.&nbsp; She then remarked that she would not allude to the
past, and would not mention that her daughter had for some time
rejected the suit of Mr. Tackleton; and that she would not say a
great many other things which she did say, at great length.&nbsp;
Finally, she delivered it as the general result of her
observation and experience, that those marriages in which there
was least of what was romantically and sillily called love, were
always the happiest; and that she anticipated the greatest
possible amount of bliss&mdash;not rapturous bliss; but the
solid, steady-going article&mdash;from the approaching
nuptials.&nbsp; She concluded by informing the company that
to-morrow was the day she had lived for, expressly; and that when
it was over, she would desire nothing better than to be packed up
and disposed of, in any genteel place of burial.</p>
<p>As these remarks were quite unanswerable&mdash;which is the
happy property of all remarks that are sufficiently wide of the
purpose&mdash;they changed the current of the conversation, and
diverted the general attention to the Veal and Ham-Pie, the cold
mutton, the potatoes, and the tart.&nbsp; In order that the
bottled beer might not be slighted, John Peerybingle proposed
To-morrow: the Wedding-Day; and called upon them to drink a
bumper to it, before he proceeded on his journey.</p>
<p>For you ought to know that he only rested there, and gave the
old horse a bait.&nbsp; He had to go some four or five miles
farther on; and when he returned in the evening, he called for
Dot, and took another rest on his way home.&nbsp; This was the
order of the day on all the Pic-Nic occasions, had been, ever
since their institution.</p>
<p>There were two persons present, besides the bride and
bridegroom elect, who did but indifferent honour to the
toast.&nbsp; One of these was Dot, too flushed and discomposed to
adapt herself to any small occurrence of the moment; the other,
Bertha, who rose up hurriedly, before the rest, and left the
table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good bye!&rsquo; said stout John Peerybingle, pulling
on his dreadnought coat.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall be back at the old
time.&nbsp; Good bye all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good bye, John,&rsquo; returned Caleb.</p>
<p>He seemed to say it by rote, and to wave his hand in the same
unconscious manner; for he stood observing Bertha with an anxious
wondering face, that never altered its expression.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good bye, young shaver!&rsquo; said the jolly Carrier,
bending down to kiss the child; which Tilly Slowboy, now intent
upon her knife and fork, had deposited asleep (and strange to
say, without damage) in a little cot of Bertha&rsquo;s
furnishing; &lsquo;good bye!&nbsp; Time will come, I suppose,
when <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> turn out into the cold, my little
friend, and leave your old father to enjoy his pipe and his
rheumatics in the chimney-corner; eh?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Dot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m here, John!&rsquo; she said, starting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; returned the Carrier, clapping his
sounding hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the pipe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I quite forgot the pipe, John.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Forgot the pipe!&nbsp; Was such a wonder ever heard of!&nbsp;
She!&nbsp; Forgot the pipe!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fill it directly.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s soon done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not so soon done, either.&nbsp; It lay in the usual
place&mdash;the Carrier&rsquo;s dreadnought pocket&mdash;with the
little pouch, her own work, from which she was used to fill it,
but her hand shook so, that she entangled it (and yet her hand
was small enough to have come out easily, I am sure), and bungled
terribly.&nbsp; The filling of the pipe and lighting it, those
little offices in which I have commended her discretion, were
vilely done, from first to last.&nbsp; During the whole process,
Tackleton stood looking on maliciously with the half-closed eye;
which, whenever it met hers&mdash;or caught it, for it can hardly
be said to have ever met another eye: rather being a kind of trap
to snatch it up&mdash;augmented her confusion in a most
remarkable degree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what a clumsy Dot you are, this afternoon!&rsquo;
said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could have done it better myself, I
verily believe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these good-natured words, he strode away, and presently
was heard, in company with Boxer, and the old horse, and the
cart, making lively music down the road.&nbsp; What time the
dreamy Caleb still stood, watching his blind daughter, with the
same expression on his face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha!&rsquo; said Caleb, softly.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
has happened?&nbsp; How changed you are, my darling, in a few
hours&mdash;since this morning.&nbsp; <i>You</i> silent and dull
all day!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Tell me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh father, father!&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl,
bursting into tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh my hard, hard
fate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he answered
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But think how cheerful and how happy you have been,
Bertha!&nbsp; How good, and how much loved, by many
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That strikes me to the heart, dear father!&nbsp; Always
so mindful of me!&nbsp; Always so kind to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb was very much perplexed to understand her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be&mdash;to be blind, Bertha, my poor dear,&rsquo;
he faltered, &lsquo;is a great affliction; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never felt it!&rsquo; cried the Blind
Girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never felt it, in its fulness.&nbsp;
Never!&nbsp; I have sometimes wished that I could see you, or
could see him&mdash;only once, dear father, only for one little
minute&mdash;that I might know what it is I treasure up,&rsquo;
she laid her hands upon her breast, &lsquo;and hold here!&nbsp;
That I might be sure and have it right!&nbsp; And sometimes (but
then I was a child) I have wept in my prayers at night, to think
that when your images ascended from my heart to Heaven, they
might not be the true resemblance of yourselves.&nbsp; But I have
never had these feelings long.&nbsp; They have passed away and
left me tranquil and contented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And they will again,&rsquo; said Caleb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, father!&nbsp; Oh my good, gentle father, bear with
me, if I am wicked!&rsquo; said the Blind Girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
is not the sorrow that so weighs me down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her father could not choose but let his moist eyes overflow;
she was so earnest and pathetic, but he did not understand her,
yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring her to me,&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot hold it closed and shut within myself.&nbsp; Bring her to
me, father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She knew he hesitated, and said, &lsquo;May.&nbsp; Bring
May!&rsquo;</p>
<p>May heard the mention of her name, and coming quietly towards
her, touched her on the arm.&nbsp; The Blind Girl turned
immediately, and held her by both hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look into my face, Dear heart, Sweet heart!&rsquo; said
Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Read it with your beautiful eyes, and tell
me if the truth is written on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Bertha, Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl still, upturning the blank sightless face, down
which the tears were coursing fast, addressed her in these
words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is not, in my soul, a wish or thought that is not
for your good, bright May!&nbsp; There is not, in my soul, a
grateful recollection stronger than the deep remembrance which is
stored there, of the many many times when, in the full pride of
sight and beauty, you have had consideration for Blind Bertha,
even when we two were children, or when Bertha was as much a
child as ever blindness can be!&nbsp; Every blessing on your
head!&nbsp; Light upon your happy course!&nbsp; Not the less, my
dear May;&rsquo; and she drew towards her, in a closer grasp;
&lsquo;not the less, my bird, because, to-day, the knowledge that
you are to be His wife has wrung my heart almost to
breaking!&nbsp; Father, May, Mary! oh forgive me that it is so,
for the sake of all he has done to relieve the weariness of my
dark life: and for the sake of the belief you have in me, when I
call Heaven to witness that I could not wish him married to a
wife more worthy of his goodness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>While speaking, she had released May Fielding&rsquo;s hands,
and clasped her garments in an attitude of mingled supplication
and love.&nbsp; Sinking lower and lower down, as she proceeded in
her strange confession, she dropped at last at the feet of her
friend, and hid her blind face in the folds of her dress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great Power!&rsquo; exclaimed her father, smitten at
one blow with the truth, &lsquo;have I deceived her from her
cradle, but to break her heart at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was well for all of them that Dot, that beaming, useful,
busy little Dot&mdash;for such she was, whatever faults she had,
and however you may learn to hate her, in good time&mdash;it was
well for all of them, I say, that she was there: or where this
would have ended, it were hard to tell.&nbsp; But Dot, recovering
her self-possession, interposed, before May could reply, or Caleb
say another word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come, dear Bertha! come away with me!&nbsp; Give
her your arm, May.&nbsp; So!&nbsp; How composed she is, you see,
already; and how good it is of her to mind us,&rsquo; said the
cheery little woman, kissing her upon the forehead.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come away, dear Bertha.&nbsp; Come! and here&rsquo;s her
good father will come with her; won&rsquo;t you, Caleb?&nbsp;
To&mdash;be&mdash;sure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, well! she was a noble little Dot in such things, and it
must have been an obdurate nature that could have withstood her
influence.&nbsp; When she had got poor Caleb and his Bertha away,
that they might comfort and console each other, as she knew they
only could, she presently came bouncing back,&mdash;the saying
is, as fresh as any daisy; I say fresher&mdash;to mount guard
over that bridling little piece of consequence in the cap and
gloves, and prevent the dear old creature from making
discoveries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So bring me the precious Baby, Tilly,&rsquo; said she,
drawing a chair to the fire; &lsquo;and while I have it in my
lap, here&rsquo;s Mrs. Fielding, Tilly, will tell me all about
the management of Babies, and put me right in twenty points where
I&rsquo;m as wrong as can be.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you, Mrs.
Fielding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not even the Welsh Giant, who, according to the popular
expression, was so &lsquo;slow&rsquo; as to perform a fatal
surgical operation upon himself, in emulation of a juggling-trick
achieved by his arch-enemy at breakfast-time; not even he fell
half so readily into the snare prepared for him, as the old lady
did into this artful pitfall.&nbsp; The fact of Tackleton having
walked out; and furthermore, of two or three people having been
talking together at a distance, for two minutes, leaving her to
her own resources; was quite enough to have put her on her
dignity, and the bewailment of that mysterious convulsion in the
Indigo trade, for four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; But this becoming
deference to her experience, on the part of the young mother, was
so irresistible, that after a short affectation of humility, she
began to enlighten her with the best grace in the world; and
sitting bolt upright before the wicked Dot, she did, in half an
hour, deliver more infallible domestic recipes and precepts, than
would (if acted on) have utterly destroyed and done up that Young
Peerybingle, though he had been an Infant Samson.</p>
<p>To change the theme, Dot did a little needlework&mdash;she
carried the contents of a whole workbox in her pocket; however
she contrived it, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;then did a little
nursing; then a little more needlework; then had a little
whispering chat with May, while the old lady dozed; and so in
little bits of bustle, which was quite her manner always, found
it a very short afternoon.&nbsp; Then, as it grew dark, and as it
was a solemn part of this Institution of the Pic-Nic that she
should perform all Bertha&rsquo;s household tasks, she trimmed
the fire, and swept the hearth, and set the tea-board out, and
drew the curtain, and lighted a candle.&nbsp; Then she played an
air or two on a rude kind of harp, which Caleb had contrived for
Bertha, and played them very well; for Nature had made her
delicate little ear as choice a one for music as it would have
been for jewels, if she had had any to wear.&nbsp; By this time
it was the established hour for having tea; and Tackleton came
back again, to share the meal, and spend the evening.</p>
<p>Caleb and Bertha had returned some time before, and Caleb had
sat down to his afternoon&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But he
couldn&rsquo;t settle to it, poor fellow, being anxious and
remorseful for his daughter.&nbsp; It was touching to see him
sitting idle on his working-stool, regarding her so wistfully,
and always saying in his face, &lsquo;Have I deceived her from
her cradle, but to break her heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When it was night, and tea was done, and Dot had nothing more
to do in washing up the cups and saucers; in a word&mdash;for I
must come to it, and there is no use in putting it off&mdash;when
the time drew nigh for expecting the Carrier&rsquo;s return in
every sound of distant wheels, her manner changed again, her
colour came and went, and she was very restless.&nbsp; Not as
good wives are, when listening for their husbands.&nbsp; No, no,
no.&nbsp; It was another sort of restlessness from that.</p>
<p>Wheels heard.&nbsp; A horse&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; The barking of
a dog.&nbsp; The gradual approach of all the sounds.&nbsp; The
scratching paw of Boxer at the door!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose step is that!&rsquo; cried Bertha, starting
up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose step?&rsquo; returned the Carrier, standing in
the portal, with his brown face ruddy as a winter berry from the
keen night air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The other step,&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
man&rsquo;s tread behind you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is not to be deceived,&rsquo; observed the Carrier,
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come along, sir.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be
welcome, never fear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in a loud tone; and as he spoke, the deaf old
gentleman entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s not so much a stranger, that you
haven&rsquo;t seen him once, Caleb,&rsquo; said the
Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll give him house-room till we
go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh surely, John, and take it as an honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s the best company on earth, to talk secrets
in,&rsquo; said John.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have reasonable good lungs,
but he tries &rsquo;em, I can tell you.&nbsp; Sit down,
sir.&nbsp; All friends here, and glad to see you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he had imparted this assurance, in a voice that amply
corroborated what he had said about his lungs, he added in his
natural tone, &lsquo;A chair in the chimney-corner, and leave to
sit quite silent and look pleasantly about him, is all he cares
for.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s easily pleased.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bertha had been listening intently.&nbsp; She called Caleb to
her side, when he had set the chair, and asked him, in a low
voice, to describe their visitor.&nbsp; When he had done so
(truly now; with scrupulous fidelity), she moved, for the first
time since he had come in, and sighed, and seemed to have no
further interest concerning him.</p>
<p>The Carrier was in high spirits, good fellow that he was, and
fonder of his little wife than ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A clumsy Dot she was, this afternoon!&rsquo; he said,
encircling her with his rough arm, as she stood, removed from the
rest; &lsquo;and yet I like her somehow.&nbsp; See yonder,
Dot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the old man.&nbsp; She looked down.&nbsp; I
think she trembled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;ha ha ha!&mdash;he&rsquo;s full of
admiration for you!&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Talked
of nothing else, the whole way here.&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s a
brave old boy.&nbsp; I like him for it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish he had had a better subject, John,&rsquo; she
said, with an uneasy glance about the room.&nbsp; At Tackleton
especially.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A better subject!&rsquo; cried the jovial John.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing.&nbsp; Come, off with the
great-coat, off with the thick shawl, off with the heavy
wrappers! and a cosy half-hour by the fire!&nbsp; My humble
service, Mistress.&nbsp; A game at cribbage, you and I?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s hearty.&nbsp; The cards and board, Dot.&nbsp; And a
glass of beer here, if there&rsquo;s any left, small
wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His challenge was addressed to the old lady, who accepting it
with gracious readiness, they were soon engaged upon the
game.&nbsp; At first, the Carrier looked about him sometimes,
with a smile, or now and then called Dot to peep over his
shoulder at his hand, and advise him on some knotty point.&nbsp;
But his adversary being a rigid disciplinarian, and subject to an
occasional weakness in respect of pegging more than she was
entitled to, required such vigilance on his part, as left him
neither eyes nor ears to spare.&nbsp; Thus, his whole attention
gradually became absorbed upon the cards; and he thought of
nothing else, until a hand upon his shoulder restored him to a
consciousness of Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to disturb you&mdash;but a word,
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to deal,&rsquo; returned the
Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a crisis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come here,
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was that in his pale face which made the other rise
immediately, and ask him, in a hurry, what the matter was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&nbsp; John Peerybingle,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry for this.&nbsp; I am
indeed.&nbsp; I have been afraid of it.&nbsp; I have suspected it
from the first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked the Carrier, with a frightened
aspect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll show you, if you&rsquo;ll come
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier accompanied him, without another word.&nbsp; They
went across a yard, where the stars were shining, and by a little
side-door, into Tackleton&rsquo;s own counting-house, where there
was a glass window, commanding the ware-room, which was closed
for the night.&nbsp; There was no light in the counting-house
itself, but there were lamps in the long narrow ware-room; and
consequently the window was bright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A moment!&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you
bear to look through that window, do you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; returned the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A moment more,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t commit any violence.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of no
use.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dangerous too.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a
strong-made man; and you might do murder before you know
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier looked him in the face, and recoiled a step as if
he had been struck.&nbsp; In one stride he was at the window, and
he saw&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh Shadow on the Hearth!&nbsp; Oh truthful Cricket!&nbsp; Oh
perfidious Wife!</p>
<p>He saw her, with the old man&mdash;old no longer, but erect
and gallant&mdash;bearing in his hand the false white hair that
had won his way into their desolate and miserable home.&nbsp; He
saw her listening to him, as he bent his head to whisper in her
ear; and suffering him to clasp her round the waist, as they
moved slowly down the dim wooden gallery towards the door by
which they had entered it.&nbsp; He saw them stop, and saw her
turn&mdash;to have the face, the face he loved so, so presented
to his view!&mdash;and saw her, with her own hands, adjust the
lie upon his head, laughing, as she did it, at his unsuspicious
nature!</p>
<p>He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if it would
have beaten down a lion.&nbsp; But opening it immediately again,
he spread it out before the eyes of Tackleton (for he was tender
of her, even then), and so, as they passed out, fell down upon a
desk, and was as weak as any infant.</p>
<p>He was wrapped up to the chin, and busy with his horse and
parcels, when she came into the room, prepared for going
home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, John, dear!&nbsp; Good night, May!&nbsp; Good
night, Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Could she kiss them?&nbsp; Could she be blithe and cheerful in
her parting?&nbsp; Could she venture to reveal her face to them
without a blush?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Tackleton observed her closely,
and she did all this.</p>
<p>Tilly was hushing the Baby, and she crossed and re-crossed
Tackleton, a dozen times, repeating drowsily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did the knowledge that it was to be its wifes, then,
wring its hearts almost to breaking; and did its fathers deceive
it from its cradles but to break its hearts at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Tilly, give me the Baby!&nbsp; Good night, Mr.
Tackleton.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s John, for goodness&rsquo;
sake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to walk beside the horse&rsquo;s
head,&rsquo; said Tackleton; who helped her to her seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear John.&nbsp; Walk?&nbsp; To-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the
affirmative; and the false stranger and the little nurse being in
their places, the old horse moved off.&nbsp; Boxer, the
unconscious Boxer, running on before, running back, running round
and round the cart, and barking as triumphantly and merrily as
ever.</p>
<p>When Tackleton had gone off likewise, escorting May and her
mother home, poor Caleb sat down by the fire beside his daughter;
anxious and remorseful at the core; and still saying in his
wistful contemplation of her, &lsquo;Have I deceived her from her
cradle, but to break her heart at last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The toys that had been set in motion for the Baby, had all
stopped, and run down, long ago.&nbsp; In the faint light and
silence, the imperturbably calm dolls, the agitated
rocking-horses with distended eyes and nostrils, the old
gentlemen at the street-doors, standing half doubled up upon
their failing knees and ankles, the wry-faced nut-crackers, the
very Beasts upon their way into the Ark, in twos, like a Boarding
School out walking, might have been imagined to be stricken
motionless with fantastic wonder, at Dot being false, or
Tackleton beloved, under any combination of circumstances.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;Chirp the Third</h2>
<p>The Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten, when the Carrier sat
down by his fireside.&nbsp; So troubled and grief-worn, that he
seemed to scare the Cuckoo, who, having cut his ten melodious
announcements as short as possible, plunged back into the Moorish
Palace again, and clapped his little door behind him, as if the
unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings.</p>
<p>If the little Haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of
scythes, and had cut at every stroke into the Carrier&rsquo;s
heart, he never could have gashed and wounded it, as Dot had
done.</p>
<p>It was a heart so full of love for her; so bound up and held
together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance, spun from
the daily working of her many qualities of endearment; it was a
heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so
closely; a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth, so strong
in right, so weak in wrong; that it could cherish neither passion
nor revenge at first, and had only room to hold the broken image
of its Idol.</p>
<p>But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding on his
hearth, now cold and dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to
rise within him, as an angry wind comes rising in the
night.&nbsp; The Stranger was beneath his outraged roof.&nbsp;
Three steps would take him to his chamber-door.&nbsp; One blow
would beat it in.&nbsp; &lsquo;You might do murder before you
know it,&rsquo; Tackleton had said.&nbsp; How could it be murder,
if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to
hand!&nbsp; He was the younger man.</p>
<p>It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his
mind.&nbsp; It was an angry thought, goading him to some avenging
act, that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place
which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night; and where
the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when
the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the stormy weather.</p>
<p>He was the younger man!&nbsp; Yes, yes; some lover who had won
the heart that <i>he</i> had never touched.&nbsp; Some lover of
her early choice, of whom she had thought and dreamed, for whom
she had pined and pined, when he had fancied her so happy by his
side.&nbsp; O agony to think of it!</p>
<p>She had been above-stairs with the Baby, getting it to
bed.&nbsp; As he sat brooding on the hearth, she came close
beside him, without his knowledge&mdash;in the turning of the
rack of his great misery, he lost all other sounds&mdash;and put
her little stool at his feet.&nbsp; He only knew it, when he felt
her hand upon his own, and saw her looking up into his face.</p>
<p>With wonder?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It was his first impression, and
he was fain to look at her again, to set it right.&nbsp; No, not
with wonder.&nbsp; With an eager and inquiring look; but not with
wonder.&nbsp; At first it was alarmed and serious; then, it
changed into a strange, wild, dreadful smile of recognition of
his thoughts; then, there was nothing but her clasped hands on
her brow, and her bent head, and falling hair.</p>
<p>Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that
moment, he had too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his
breast, to have turned one feather&rsquo;s weight of it against
her.&nbsp; But he could not bear to see her crouching down upon
the little seat where he had often looked on her, with love and
pride, so innocent and gay; and, when she rose and left him,
sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief to have the vacant place
beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence.&nbsp; This
in itself was anguish keener than all, reminding him how desolate
he was become, and how the great bond of his life was rent
asunder.</p>
<p>The more he felt this, and the more he knew he could have
better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with
their little child upon her breast, the higher and the stronger
rose his wrath against his enemy.&nbsp; He looked about him for a
weapon.</p>
<p>There was a gun, hanging on the wall.&nbsp; He took it down,
and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious
Stranger&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He knew the gun was loaded.&nbsp;
Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild
beast, seized him, and dilated in his mind until it grew into a
monstrous demon in complete possession of him, casting out all
milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire.</p>
<p>That phrase is wrong.&nbsp; Not casting out his milder
thoughts, but artfully transforming them.&nbsp; Changing them
into scourges to drive him on.&nbsp; Turning water into blood,
love into hate, gentleness into blind ferocity.&nbsp; Her image,
sorrowing, humbled, but still pleading to his tenderness and
mercy with resistless power, never left his mind; but, staying
there, it urged him to the door; raised the weapon to his
shoulder; fitted and nerved his finger to the trigger; and cried
&lsquo;Kill him!&nbsp; In his bed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door; he already
held it lifted in the air; some indistinct design was in his
thoughts of calling out to him to fly, for God&rsquo;s sake, by
the window&mdash;</p>
<p>When, suddenly, the struggling fire illumined the whole
chimney with a glow of light; and the Cricket on the Hearth began
to Chirp!</p>
<p>No sound he could have heard, no human voice, not even hers,
could so have moved and softened him.&nbsp; The artless words in
which she had told him of her love for this same Cricket, were
once more freshly spoken; her trembling, earnest manner at the
moment, was again before him; her pleasant voice&mdash;O what a
voice it was, for making household music at the fireside of an
honest man!&mdash;thrilled through and through his better nature,
and awoke it into life and action.</p>
<p>He recoiled from the door, like a man walking in his sleep,
awakened from a frightful dream; and put the gun aside.&nbsp;
Clasping his hands before his face, he then sat down again beside
the fire, and found relief in tears.</p>
<p>The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in
Fairy shape before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I love it,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the Fairy Voice,
repeating what he well remembered, &lsquo;&ldquo;for the many
times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music
has given me.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said so!&rsquo; cried the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;True!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;This has been a happy home, John; and I love the
Cricket for its sake!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been, Heaven knows,&rsquo; returned the
Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;She made it happy, always,&mdash;until
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So gracefully sweet-tempered; so domestic, joyful,
busy, and light-hearted!&rsquo; said the Voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,&rsquo;
returned the Carrier.</p>
<p>The Voice, correcting him, said &lsquo;do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier repeated &lsquo;as I did.&rsquo;&nbsp; But not
firmly.&nbsp; His faltering tongue resisted his control, and
would speak in its own way, for itself and him.</p>
<p>The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised its hand and
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon your own hearth&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hearth she has blighted,&rsquo; interposed the
Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hearth she has&mdash;how often!&mdash;blessed and
brightened,&rsquo; said the Cricket; &lsquo;the hearth which, but
for her, were only a few stones and bricks and rusty bars, but
which has been, through her, the Altar of your Home; on which you
have nightly sacrificed some petty passion, selfishness, or care,
and offered up the homage of a tranquil mind, a trusting nature,
and an overflowing heart; so that the smoke from this poor
chimney has gone upward with a better fragrance than the richest
incense that is burnt before the richest shrines in all the gaudy
temples of this world!&mdash;Upon your own hearth; in its quiet
sanctuary; surrounded by its gentle influences and associations;
hear her!&nbsp; Hear me!&nbsp; Hear everything that speaks the
language of your hearth and home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And pleads for her?&rsquo; inquired the Carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All things that speak the language of your hearth and
home, must plead for her!&rsquo; returned the Cricket.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For they speak the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And while the Carrier, with his head upon his hands, continued
to sit meditating in his chair, the Presence stood beside him,
suggesting his reflections by its power, and presenting them
before him, as in a glass or picture.&nbsp; It was not a solitary
Presence.&nbsp; From the hearthstone, from the chimney, from the
clock, the pipe, the kettle, and the cradle; from the floor, the
walls, the ceiling, and the stairs; from the cart without, and
the cupboard within, and the household implements; from every
thing and every place with which she had ever been familiar, and
with which she had ever entwined one recollection of herself in
her unhappy husband&rsquo;s mind; Fairies came trooping
forth.&nbsp; Not to stand beside him as the Cricket did, but to
busy and bestir themselves.&nbsp; To do all honour to her
image.&nbsp; To pull him by the skirts, and point to it when it
appeared.&nbsp; To cluster round it, and embrace it, and strew
flowers for it to tread on.&nbsp; To try to crown its fair head
with their tiny hands.&nbsp; To show that they were fond of it
and loved it; and that there was not one ugly, wicked or
accusatory creature to claim knowledge of it&mdash;none but their
playful and approving selves.</p>
<p>His thoughts were constant to her image.&nbsp; It was always
there.</p>
<p>She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and singing to
herself.&nbsp; Such a blithe, thriving, steady little Dot!&nbsp;
The fairy figures turned upon him all at once, by one consent,
with one prodigious concentrated stare, and seemed to say,
&lsquo;Is this the light wife you are mourning for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and
noisy tongues, and laughter.&nbsp; A crowd of young merry-makers
came pouring in, among whom were May Fielding and a score of
pretty girls.&nbsp; Dot was the fairest of them all; as young as
any of them too.&nbsp; They came to summon her to join their
party.&nbsp; It was a dance.&nbsp; If ever little foot were made
for dancing, hers was, surely.&nbsp; But she laughed, and shook
her head, and pointed to her cookery on the fire, and her table
ready spread: with an exulting defiance that rendered her more
charming than she was before.&nbsp; And so she merrily dismissed
them, nodding to her would-be partners, one by one, as they
passed, but with a comical indifference, enough to make them go
and drown themselves immediately if they were her
admirers&mdash;and they must have been so, more or less; they
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; And yet indifference was not her
character.&nbsp; O no!&nbsp; For presently, there came a certain
Carrier to the door; and bless her what a welcome she bestowed
upon him!</p>
<p>Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and
seemed to say, &lsquo;Is this the wife who has forsaken
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture: call it what you
will.&nbsp; A great shadow of the Stranger, as he first stood
underneath their roof; covering its surface, and blotting out all
other objects.&nbsp; But the nimble Fairies worked like bees to
clear it off again.&nbsp; And Dot again was there.&nbsp; Still
bright and beautiful.</p>
<p>Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it softly,
and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in
the musing figure by which the Fairy Cricket stood.</p>
<p>The night&mdash;I mean the real night: not going by Fairy
clocks&mdash;was wearing now; and in this stage of the
Carrier&rsquo;s thoughts, the moon burst out, and shone brightly
in the sky.&nbsp; Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen
also, in his mind; and he could think more soberly of what had
happened.</p>
<p>Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the
glass&mdash;always distinct, and big, and thoroughly
defined&mdash;it never fell so darkly as at first.&nbsp; Whenever
it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general cry of consternation,
and plied their little arms and legs, with inconceivable
activity, to rub it out.&nbsp; And whenever they got at Dot
again, and showed her to him once more, bright and beautiful,
they cheered in the most inspiring manner.</p>
<p>They never showed her, otherwise than beautiful and bright,
for they were Household Spirits to whom falsehood is
annihilation; and being so, what Dot was there for them, but the
one active, beaming, pleasant little creature who had been the
light and sun of the Carrier&rsquo;s Home!</p>
<p>The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her,
with the Baby, gossiping among a knot of sage old matrons, and
affecting to be wondrous old and matronly herself, and leaning in
a staid, demure old way upon her husband&rsquo;s arm,
attempting&mdash;she! such a bud of a little woman&mdash;to
convey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in
general, and of being the sort of person to whom it was no
novelty at all to be a mother; yet in the same breath, they
showed her, laughing at the Carrier for being awkward, and
pulling up his shirt-collar to make him smart, and mincing
merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance!</p>
<p>They turned, and stared immensely at him when they showed her
with the Blind Girl; for, though she carried cheerfulness and
animation with her wheresoever she went, she bore those
influences into Caleb Plummer&rsquo;s home, heaped up and running
over.&nbsp; The Blind Girl&rsquo;s love for her, and trust in
her, and gratitude to her; her own good busy way of setting
Bertha&rsquo;s thanks aside; her dexterous little arts for
filling up each moment of the visit in doing something useful to
the house, and really working hard while feigning to make
holiday; her bountiful provision of those standing delicacies,
the Veal and Ham-Pie and the bottles of Beer; her radiant little
face arriving at the door, and taking leave; the wonderful
expression in her whole self, from her neat foot to the crown of
her head, of being a part of the establishment&mdash;a something
necessary to it, which it couldn&rsquo;t be without; all this the
Fairies revelled in, and loved her for.&nbsp; And once again they
looked upon him all at once, appealingly, and seemed to say,
while some among them nestled in her dress and fondled her,
&lsquo;Is this the wife who has betrayed your
confidence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>More than once, or twice, or thrice, in the long thoughtful
night, they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with
her bent head, her hands clasped on her brow, her falling
hair.&nbsp; As he had seen her last.&nbsp; And when they found
her thus, they neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered
close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and pressed on one
another to show sympathy and kindness to her, and forgot him
altogether.</p>
<p>Thus the night passed.&nbsp; The moon went down; the stars
grew pale; the cold day broke; the sun rose.&nbsp; The Carrier
still sat, musing, in the chimney corner.&nbsp; He had sat there,
with his head upon his hands, all night.&nbsp; All night the
faithful Cricket had been Chirp, Chirp, Chirping on the
Hearth.&nbsp; All night he had listened to its voice.&nbsp; All
night the household Fairies had been busy with him.&nbsp; All
night she had been amiable and blameless in the glass, except
when that one shadow fell upon it.</p>
<p>He rose up when it was broad day, and washed and dressed
himself.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t go about his customary cheerful
avocations&mdash;he wanted spirit for them&mdash;but it mattered
the less, that it was Tackleton&rsquo;s wedding-day, and he had
arranged to make his rounds by proxy.&nbsp; He thought to have
gone merrily to church with Dot.&nbsp; But such plans were at an
end.&nbsp; It was their own wedding-day too.&nbsp; Ah! how little
he had looked for such a close to such a year!</p>
<p>The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would pay him an early
visit; and he was right.&nbsp; He had not walked to and fro
before his own door, many minutes, when he saw the Toy-merchant
coming in his chaise along the road.&nbsp; As the chaise drew
nearer, he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely for
his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse&rsquo;s head
with flowers and favours.</p>
<p>The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton,
whose half-closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than
ever.&nbsp; But the Carrier took little heed of this.&nbsp; His
thoughts had other occupation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John Peerybingle!&rsquo; said Tackleton, with an air of
condolence.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good fellow, how do you find yourself
this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton,&rsquo;
returned the Carrier, shaking his head: &lsquo;for I have been a
good deal disturbed in my mind.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s over
now!&nbsp; Can you spare me half an hour or so, for some private
talk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came on purpose,&rsquo; returned Tackleton,
alighting.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind the horse.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
stand quiet enough, with the reins over this post, if
you&rsquo;ll give him a mouthful of hay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier having brought it from his stable, and set it
before him, they turned into the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not married before noon,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;I think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Plenty of
time.&nbsp; Plenty of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was rapping at
the Stranger&rsquo;s door; which was only removed from it by a
few steps.&nbsp; One of her very red eyes (for Tilly had been
crying all night long, because her mistress cried) was at the
keyhole; and she was knocking very loud; and seemed
frightened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please I can&rsquo;t make nobody hear,&rsquo;
said Tilly, looking round.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope nobody an&rsquo;t
gone and been and died if you please!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised with various
new raps and kicks at the door; which led to no result
whatever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I go?&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s curious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier, who had turned his face from the door, signed to
him to go if he would.</p>
<p>So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy&rsquo;s relief; and he too
kicked and knocked; and he too failed to get the least
reply.&nbsp; But he thought of trying the handle of the door; and
as it opened easily, he peeped in, looked in, went in, and soon
came running out again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;John Peerybingle,&rsquo; said Tackleton, in his
ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope there has been nothing&mdash;nothing
rash in the night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier turned upon him quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo; said Tackleton;
&lsquo;and the window&rsquo;s open.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see any
marks&mdash;to be sure it&rsquo;s almost on a level with the
garden: but I was afraid there might have been some&mdash;some
scuffle.&nbsp; Eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether; he looked at
him so hard.&nbsp; And he gave his eye, and his face, and his
whole person, a sharp twist.&nbsp; As if he would have screwed
the truth out of him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make yourself easy,&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He went into that room last night, without harm in word or
deed from me, and no one has entered it since.&nbsp; He is away
of his own free will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d go out gladly at that door,
and beg my bread from house to house, for life, if I could so
change the past that he had never come.&nbsp; But he has come and
gone.&nbsp; And I have done with him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&mdash;Well, I think he has got off pretty
easy,&rsquo; said Tackleton, taking a chair.</p>
<p>The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down too, and
shaded his face with his hand, for some little time, before
proceeding.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You showed me last night,&rsquo; he said at length,
&lsquo;my wife; my wife that I love; secretly&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And tenderly,&rsquo; insinuated Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conniving at that man&rsquo;s disguise, and giving him
opportunities of meeting her alone.&nbsp; I think there&rsquo;s
no sight I wouldn&rsquo;t have rather seen than that.&nbsp; I
think there&rsquo;s no man in the world I wouldn&rsquo;t have
rather had to show it me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess to having had my suspicions always,&rsquo;
said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that has made me objectionable
here, I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But as you did show it me,&rsquo; pursued the Carrier,
not minding him; &lsquo;and as you saw her, my wife, my wife that
I love&rsquo;&mdash;his voice, and eye, and hand, grew steadier
and firmer as he repeated these words: evidently in pursuance of
a steadfast purpose&mdash;&lsquo;as you saw her at this
disadvantage, it is right and just that you should also see with
my eyes, and look into my breast, and know what my mind is, upon
the subject.&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s settled,&rsquo; said the
Carrier, regarding him attentively.&nbsp; &lsquo;And nothing can
shake it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent, about its
being necessary to vindicate something or other; but he was
overawed by the manner of his companion.&nbsp; Plain and
unpolished as it was, it had a something dignified and noble in
it, which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the
man could have imparted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a plain, rough man,&rsquo; pursued the Carrier,
&lsquo;with very little to recommend me.&nbsp; I am not a clever
man, as you very well know.&nbsp; I am not a young man.&nbsp; I
loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow up, from a
child, in her father&rsquo;s house; because I knew how precious
she was; because she had been my life, for years and years.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s many men I can&rsquo;t compare with, who never
could have loved my little Dot like me, I think!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused, and softly beat the ground a short time with his
foot, before resuming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I often thought that though I wasn&rsquo;t good enough
for her, I should make her a kind husband, and perhaps know her
value better than another; and in this way I reconciled it to
myself, and came to think it might be possible that we should be
married.&nbsp; And in the end it came about, and we were
married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; said Tackleton, with a significant shake of
the head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had studied myself; I had had experience of myself; I
knew how much I loved her, and how happy I should be,&rsquo;
pursued the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I had not&mdash;I feel it
now&mdash;sufficiently considered her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love of
admiration!&nbsp; Not considered!&nbsp; All left out of
sight!&nbsp; Hah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had best not interrupt me,&rsquo; said the Carrier,
with some sternness, &lsquo;till you understand me; and
you&rsquo;re wide of doing so.&nbsp; If, yesterday, I&rsquo;d
have struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe a word
against her, to-day I&rsquo;d set my foot upon his face, if he
was my brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Toy-merchant gazed at him in astonishment.&nbsp; He went
on in a softer tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I consider,&rsquo; said the Carrier, &lsquo;that I
took her&mdash;at her age, and with her beauty&mdash;from her
young companions, and the many scenes of which she was the
ornament; in which she was the brightest little star that ever
shone, to shut her up from day to day in my dull house, and keep
my tedious company?&nbsp; Did I consider how little suited I was
to her sprightly humour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me
must be, to one of her quick spirit?&nbsp; Did I consider that it
was no merit in me, or claim in me, that I loved her, when
everybody must, who knew her?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; I took advantage
of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition; and I married
her.&nbsp; I wish I never had!&nbsp; For her sake; not for
mine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Toy-merchant gazed at him, without winking.&nbsp; Even the
half-shut eye was open now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven bless her!&rsquo; said the Carrier, &lsquo;for
the cheerful constancy with which she tried to keep the knowledge
of this from me!&nbsp; And Heaven help me, that, in my slow mind,
I have not found it out before!&nbsp; Poor child!&nbsp; Poor
Dot!&nbsp; <i>I</i> not to find it out, who have seen her eyes
fill with tears, when such a marriage as our own was spoken
of!&nbsp; I, who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a
hundred times, and never suspected it till last night!&nbsp; Poor
girl!&nbsp; That I could ever hope she would be fond of me!&nbsp;
That I could ever believe she was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She made a show of it,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She made such a show of it, that to tell you the truth it
was the origin of my misgivings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And here he asserted the superiority of May Fielding, who
certainly made no sort of show of being fond of <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has tried,&rsquo; said the poor Carrier, with
greater emotion than he had exhibited yet; &lsquo;I only now
begin to know how hard she has tried, to be my dutiful and
zealous wife.&nbsp; How good she has been; how much she has done;
how brave and strong a heart she has; let the happiness I have
known under this roof bear witness!&nbsp; It will be some help
and comfort to me, when I am here alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here alone?&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Then you do mean to take some notice of
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; returned the Carrier, &lsquo;to do her
the greatest kindness, and make her the best reparation, in my
power.&nbsp; I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal
marriage, and the struggle to conceal it.&nbsp; She shall be as
free as I can render her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make <i>her</i> reparation!&rsquo; exclaimed Tackleton,
twisting and turning his great ears with his hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There must be something wrong here.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t
say that, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the Toy-merchant,
and shook him like a reed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Listen to me!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And take
care that you hear me right.&nbsp; Listen to me.&nbsp; Do I speak
plainly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very plainly indeed,&rsquo; answered Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As if I meant it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very much as if you meant it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,&rsquo;
exclaimed the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;On the spot where she has
often sat beside me, with her sweet face looking into mine.&nbsp;
I called up her whole life, day by day.&nbsp; I had her dear
self, in its every passage, in review before me.&nbsp; And upon
my soul she is innocent, if there is One to judge the innocent
and guilty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Staunch Cricket on the Hearth!&nbsp; Loyal household
Fairies!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Passion and distrust have left me!&rsquo; said the
Carrier; &lsquo;and nothing but my grief remains.&nbsp; In an
unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to her tastes and
years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will;
returned.&nbsp; In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and
wanting time to think of what she did, she made herself a party
to his treachery, by concealing it.&nbsp; Last night she saw him,
in the interview we witnessed.&nbsp; It was wrong.&nbsp; But
otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth on
earth!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that is your opinion&rsquo;&mdash;Tackleton
began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, let her go!&rsquo; pursued the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Go, with my blessing for the many happy hours she has
given me, and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused
me.&nbsp; Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish
her!&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll never hate me.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll learn
to like me better, when I&rsquo;m not a drag upon her, and she
wears the chain I have riveted, more lightly.&nbsp; This is the
day on which I took her, with so little thought for her
enjoyment, from her home.&nbsp; To-day she shall return to it,
and I will trouble her no more.&nbsp; Her father and mother will
be here to-day&mdash;we had made a little plan for keeping it
together&mdash;and they shall take her home.&nbsp; I can trust
her, there, or anywhere.&nbsp; She leaves me without blame, and
she will live so I am sure.&nbsp; If I should die&mdash;I may
perhaps while she is still young; I have lost some courage in a
few hours&mdash;she&rsquo;ll find that I remembered her, and
loved her to the last!&nbsp; This is the end of what you showed
me.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s over!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, John, not over.&nbsp; Do not say it&rsquo;s over
yet!&nbsp; Not quite yet.&nbsp; I have heard your noble
words.&nbsp; I could not steal away, pretending to be ignorant of
what has affected me with such deep gratitude.&nbsp; Do not say
it&rsquo;s over, &lsquo;till the clock has struck
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had remained
there.&nbsp; She never looked at Tackleton, but fixed her eyes
upon her husband.&nbsp; But she kept away from him, setting as
wide a space as possible between them; and though she spoke with
most impassioned earnestness, she went no nearer to him even
then.&nbsp; How different in this from her old self!</p>
<p>&lsquo;No hand can make the clock which will strike again for
me the hours that are gone,&rsquo; replied the Carrier, with a
faint smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;But let it be so, if you will, my
dear.&nbsp; It will strike soon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s of little
matter what we say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d try to please you in a harder
case than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; muttered Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must be
off, for when the clock strikes again, it&rsquo;ll be necessary
for me to be upon my way to church.&nbsp; Good morning, John
Peerybingle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry to be deprived of the pleasure
of your company.&nbsp; Sorry for the loss, and the occasion of it
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have spoken plainly?&rsquo; said the Carrier,
accompanying him to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh quite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll remember what I have said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, if you compel me to make the observation,&rsquo;
said Tackleton, previously taking the precaution of getting into
his chaise; &lsquo;I must say that it was so very unexpected,
that I&rsquo;m far from being likely to forget it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The better for us both,&rsquo; returned the
Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good bye.&nbsp; I give you joy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could give it to <i>you</i>,&rsquo; said
Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;As I can&rsquo;t; thank&rsquo;ee.&nbsp;
Between ourselves, (as I told you before, eh?) I don&rsquo;t much
think I shall have the less joy in my married life, because May
hasn&rsquo;t been too officious about me, and too
demonstrative.&nbsp; Good bye!&nbsp; Take care of
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in
the distance than his horse&rsquo;s flowers and favours near at
hand; and then, with a deep sigh, went strolling like a restless,
broken man, among some neighbouring elms; unwilling to return
until the clock was on the eve of striking.</p>
<p>His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously; but often
dried her eyes and checked herself, to say how good he was, how
excellent he was! and once or twice she laughed; so heartily,
triumphantly, and incoherently (still crying all the time), that
Tilly was quite horrified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ow if you please don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Tilly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s enough to dead and bury the Baby, so it is if
you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you bring him sometimes, to see his father,
Tilly,&rsquo; inquired her mistress, drying her eyes; &lsquo;when
I can&rsquo;t live here, and have gone to my old home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ow if you please don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; cried Tilly,
throwing back her head, and bursting out into a howl&mdash;she
looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ow if
you please don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Ow, what has everybody gone and
been and done with everybody, making everybody else so
wretched!&nbsp; Ow-w-w-w!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The soft-hearted Slowboy trailed off at this juncture, into
such a deplorable howl, the more tremendous from its long
suppression, that she must infallibly have awakened the Baby, and
frightened him into something serious (probably convulsions), if
her eyes had not encountered Caleb Plummer, leading in his
daughter.&nbsp; This spectacle restoring her to a sense of the
proprieties, she stood for some few moments silent, with her
mouth wide open; and then, posting off to the bed on which the
Baby lay asleep, danced in a weird, Saint Vitus manner on the
floor, and at the same time rummaged with her face and head among
the bedclothes, apparently deriving much relief from those
extraordinary operations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary!&rsquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not at the
marriage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told her you would not be there, mum,&rsquo;
whispered Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;I heard as much last night.&nbsp;
But bless you,&rsquo; said the little man, taking her tenderly by
both hands, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for what they say.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe them.&nbsp; There an&rsquo;t much of me, but
that little should be torn to pieces sooner than I&rsquo;d trust
a word against you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He put his arms about her and hugged her, as a child might
have hugged one of his own dolls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha couldn&rsquo;t stay at home this morning,&rsquo;
said Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;She was afraid, I know, to hear the
bells ring, and couldn&rsquo;t trust herself to be so near them
on their wedding-day.&nbsp; So we started in good time, and came
here.&nbsp; I have been thinking of what I have done,&rsquo; said
Caleb, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &lsquo;I have been blaming
myself till I hardly knew what to do or where to turn, for the
distress of mind I have caused her; and I&rsquo;ve come to the
conclusion that I&rsquo;d better, if you&rsquo;ll stay with me,
mum, the while, tell her the truth.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll stay with
me the while?&rsquo; he inquired, trembling from head to
foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what effect it may have
upon her; I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll think of me; I
don&rsquo;t know that she&rsquo;ll ever care for her poor father
afterwards.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s best for her that she should be
undeceived, and I must bear the consequences as I
deserve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; said Bertha, &lsquo;where is your
hand!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Here it is here it is!&rsquo; pressing it
to her lips, with a smile, and drawing it through her arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I heard them speaking softly among themselves, last night,
of some blame against you.&nbsp; They were wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier&rsquo;s Wife was silent.&nbsp; Caleb answered for
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were wrong,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew it!&rsquo; cried Bertha, proudly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
told them so.&nbsp; I scorned to hear a word!&nbsp; Blame
<i>her</i> with justice!&rsquo; she pressed the hand between her
own, and the soft cheek against her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;No!&nbsp;
I am not so blind as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon
the other: holding her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you all,&rsquo; said Bertha, &lsquo;better than
you think.&nbsp; But none so well as her.&nbsp; Not even you,
father.&nbsp; There is nothing half so real and so true about me,
as she is.&nbsp; If I could be restored to sight this instant,
and not a word were spoken, I could choose her from a
crowd!&nbsp; My sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bertha, my dear!&rsquo; said Caleb, &lsquo;I have
something on my mind I want to tell you, while we three are
alone.&nbsp; Hear me kindly!&nbsp; I have a confession to make to
you, my darling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A confession, father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have wandered from the truth and lost myself, my
child,&rsquo; said Caleb, with a pitiable expression in his
bewildered face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have wandered from the truth,
intending to be kind to you; and have been cruel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, and repeated
&lsquo;Cruel!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha,&rsquo; said
Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll say so, presently.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll be the first to tell him so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He cruel to me!&rsquo; cried Bertha, with a smile of
incredulity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not meaning it, my child,&rsquo; said Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I have been; though I never suspected it, till
yesterday.&nbsp; My dear blind daughter, hear me and forgive
me!&nbsp; The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn&rsquo;t
exist as I have represented it.&nbsp; The eyes you have trusted
in, have been false to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him still; but
drew back, and clung closer to her friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your road in life was rough, my poor one,&rsquo; said
Caleb, &lsquo;and I meant to smooth it for you.&nbsp; I have
altered objects, changed the characters of people, invented many
things that never have been, to make you happier.&nbsp; I have
had concealments from you, put deceptions on you, God forgive me!
and surrounded you with fancies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But living people are not fancies!&rsquo; she said
hurriedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring from
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t change them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done so, Bertha,&rsquo; pleaded Caleb.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is one person that you know, my
dove&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh father! why do you say, I know?&rsquo; she answered,
in a term of keen reproach.&nbsp; &lsquo;What and whom do
<i>I</i> know!&nbsp; I who have no leader!&nbsp; I so miserably
blind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her hands, as
if she were groping her way; then spread them, in a manner most
forlorn and sad, upon her face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The marriage that takes place to-day,&rsquo; said
Caleb, &lsquo;is with a stern, sordid, grinding man.&nbsp; A hard
master to you and me, my dear, for many years.&nbsp; Ugly in his
looks, and in his nature.&nbsp; Cold and callous always.&nbsp;
Unlike what I have painted him to you in everything, my
child.&nbsp; In everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh why,&rsquo; cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it
seemed, almost beyond endurance, &lsquo;why did you ever do
this!&nbsp; Why did you ever fill my heart so full, and then come
in like Death, and tear away the objects of my love!&nbsp; O
Heaven, how blind I am!&nbsp; How helpless and alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her afflicted father hung his head, and offered no reply but
in his penitence and sorrow.</p>
<p>She had been but a short time in this passion of regret, when
the Cricket on the Hearth, unheard by all but her, began to
chirp.&nbsp; Not merrily, but in a low, faint, sorrowing
way.&nbsp; It was so mournful that her tears began to flow; and
when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all night,
appeared behind her, pointing to her father, they fell down like
rain.</p>
<p>She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and was
conscious, through her blindness, of the Presence hovering about
her father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; said the Blind Girl, &lsquo;tell me what
my home is.&nbsp; What it truly is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare
indeed.&nbsp; The house will scarcely keep out wind and rain
another winter.&nbsp; It is as roughly shielded from the weather,
Bertha,&rsquo; Dot continued in a low, clear voice, &lsquo;as
your poor father in his sack-cloth coat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the
Carrier&rsquo;s little wife aside.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those presents that I took such care of; that came
almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome to me,&rsquo; she
said, trembling; &lsquo;where did they come from?&nbsp; Did you
send them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dot saw she knew, already, and was silent.&nbsp; The Blind
Girl spread her hands before her face again.&nbsp; But in quite
another manner now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Mary, a moment.&nbsp; One moment?&nbsp; More this
way.&nbsp; Speak softly to me.&nbsp; You are true, I know.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d not deceive me now; would you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Bertha, indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am sure you would not.&nbsp; You have too much
pity for me.&nbsp; Mary, look across the room to where we were
just now&mdash;to where my father is&mdash;my father, so
compassionate and loving to me&mdash;and tell me what you
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Dot, who understood her well,
&lsquo;an old man sitting in a chair, and leaning sorrowfully on
the back, with his face resting on his hand.&nbsp; As if his
child should comfort him, Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; She will.&nbsp; Go on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is an old man, worn with care and work.&nbsp; He is
a spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man.&nbsp; I see him
now, despondent and bowed down, and striving against
nothing.&nbsp; But, Bertha, I have seen him many times before,
and striving hard in many ways for one great sacred object.&nbsp;
And I honour his grey head, and bless him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Blind Girl broke away from her; and throwing herself upon
her knees before him, took the grey head to her breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my sight restored.&nbsp; It is my sight!&rsquo;
she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been blind, and now my eyes are
open.&nbsp; I never knew him!&nbsp; To think I might have died,
and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were no words for Caleb&rsquo;s emotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is not a gallant figure on this earth,&rsquo;
exclaimed the Blind Girl, holding him in her embrace, &lsquo;that
I would love so dearly, and would cherish so devotedly, as
this!&nbsp; The greyer, and more worn, the dearer, father!&nbsp;
Never let them say I am blind again.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a
furrow in his face, there&rsquo;s not a hair upon his head, that
shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb managed to articulate &lsquo;My Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in my blindness, I believed him,&rsquo; said the
girl, caressing him with tears of exquisite affection, &lsquo;to
be so different!&nbsp; And having him beside me, day by day, so
mindful of me&mdash;always, never dreamed of this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fresh smart father in the blue coat, Bertha,&rsquo;
said poor Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing is gone,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dearest father, no!&nbsp; Everything is here&mdash;in
you.&nbsp; The father that I loved so well; the father that I
never loved enough, and never knew; the benefactor whom I first
began to reverence and love, because he had such sympathy for me;
All are here in you.&nbsp; Nothing is dead to me.&nbsp; The soul
of all that was most dear to me is here&mdash;here, with the worn
face, and the grey head.&nbsp; And I am <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> blind, father, any longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dot&rsquo;s whole attention had been concentrated, during this
discourse, upon the father and daughter; but looking, now,
towards the little Haymaker in the Moorish meadow, she saw that
the clock was within a few minutes of striking, and fell,
immediately, into a nervous and excited state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; said Bertha, hesitating.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear,&rsquo; returned Caleb.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here
she is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no change in <i>her</i>.&nbsp; You never told
me anything of <i>her</i> that was not true?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have done it, my dear, I am afraid,&rsquo;
returned Caleb, &lsquo;if I could have made her better than she
was.&nbsp; But I must have changed her for the worse, if I had
changed her at all.&nbsp; Nothing could improve her,
Bertha.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the
question, her delight and pride in the reply and her renewed
embrace of Dot, were charming to behold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;More changes than you think for, may happen though, my
dear,&rsquo; said Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Changes for the better, I
mean; changes for great joy to some of us.&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t let them startle you too much, if any such should
ever happen, and affect you?&nbsp; Are those wheels upon the
road?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a quick ear, Bertha.&nbsp; Are they
wheels?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Coming very fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I know you have a quick ear,&rsquo;
said Dot, placing her hand upon her heart, and evidently talking
on, as fast as she could to hide its palpitating state,
&lsquo;because I have noticed it often, and because you were so
quick to find out that strange step last night.&nbsp; Though why
you should have said, as I very well recollect you did say,
Bertha, &ldquo;Whose step is that!&rdquo; and why you should have
taken any greater observation of it than of any other step, I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Though as I said just now, there are
great changes in the world: great changes: and we can&rsquo;t do
better than prepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Caleb wondered what this meant; perceiving that she spoke to
him, no less than to his daughter.&nbsp; He saw her, with
astonishment, so fluttered and distressed that she could scarcely
breathe; and holding to a chair, to save herself from
falling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are wheels indeed!&rsquo; she panted.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Coming nearer!&nbsp; Nearer!&nbsp; Very close!&nbsp; And
now you hear them stopping at the garden-gate!&nbsp; And now you
hear a step outside the door&mdash;the same step, Bertha, is it
not!&mdash;and now!&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight; and running
up to Caleb put her hands upon his eyes, as a young man rushed
into the room, and flinging away his hat into the air, came
sweeping down upon them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it over?&rsquo; cried Dot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happily over?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you recollect the voice, dear Caleb?&nbsp; Did you
ever hear the like of it before?&rsquo; cried Dot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If my boy in the Golden South Americas was
alive&rsquo;&mdash;said Caleb, trembling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is alive!&rsquo; shrieked Dot, removing her hands
from his eyes, and clapping them in ecstasy; &lsquo;look at
him!&nbsp; See where he stands before you, healthy and
strong!&nbsp; Your own dear son!&nbsp; Your own dear living,
loving brother, Bertha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All honour to the little creature for her transports!&nbsp;
All honour to her tears and laughter, when the three were locked
in one another&rsquo;s arms!&nbsp; All honour to the heartiness
with which she met the sunburnt sailor-fellow, with his dark
streaming hair, half-way, and never turned her rosy little mouth
aside, but suffered him to kiss it, freely, and to press her to
his bounding heart!</p>
<p>And honour to the Cuckoo too&mdash;why not!&mdash;for bursting
out of the trap-door in the Moorish Palace like a house-breaker,
and hiccoughing twelve times on the assembled company, as if he
had got drunk for joy!</p>
<p>The Carrier, entering, started back.&nbsp; And well he might,
to find himself in such good company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, John!&rsquo; said Caleb, exultingly, &lsquo;look
here!&nbsp; My own boy from the Golden South Americas!&nbsp; My
own son!&nbsp; Him that you fitted out, and sent away
yourself!&nbsp; Him that you were always such a friend
to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand; but, recoiling,
as some feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf
Man in the Cart, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Edward!&nbsp; Was it you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now tell him all!&rsquo; cried Dot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell
him all, Edward; and don&rsquo;t spare me, for nothing shall make
me spare myself in his eyes, ever again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was the man,&rsquo; said Edward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your
old friend?&rsquo; rejoined the Carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;There was a
frank boy once&mdash;how many years is it, Caleb, since we heard
that he was dead, and had it proved, we thought?&mdash;who never
would have done that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a generous friend of mine, once; more a
father to me than a friend;&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;who never
would have judged me, or any other man, unheard.&nbsp; You were
he.&nbsp; So I am certain you will hear me now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who still kept far
away from him, replied, &lsquo;Well! that&rsquo;s but fair.&nbsp;
I will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must know that when I left here, a boy,&rsquo; said
Edward, &lsquo;I was in love, and my love was returned.&nbsp; She
was a very young girl, who perhaps (you may tell me) didn&rsquo;t
know her own mind.&nbsp; But I knew mine, and I had a passion for
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had!&rsquo; exclaimed the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I had,&rsquo; returned the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And she returned it.&nbsp; I have ever since believed she
did, and now I am sure she did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heaven help me!&rsquo; said the Carrier.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This is worse than all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Constant to her,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;and
returning, full of hope, after many hardships and perils, to
redeem my part of our old contract, I heard, twenty miles away,
that she was false to me; that she had forgotten me; and had
bestowed herself upon another and a richer man.&nbsp; I had no
mind to reproach her; but I wished to see her, and to prove
beyond dispute that this was true.&nbsp; I hoped she might have
been forced into it, against her own desire and
recollection.&nbsp; It would be small comfort, but it would be
some, I thought, and on I came.&nbsp; That I might have the
truth, the real truth; observing freely for myself, and judging
for myself, without obstruction on the one hand, or presenting my
own influence (if I had any) before her, on the other; I dressed
myself unlike myself&mdash;you know how; and waited on the
road&mdash;you know where.&nbsp; You had no suspicion of me;
neither had&mdash;had she,&rsquo; pointing to Dot, &lsquo;until I
whispered in her ear at that fireside, and she so nearly betrayed
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But when she knew that Edward was alive, and had come
back,&rsquo; sobbed Dot, now speaking for herself, as she had
burned to do, all through this narrative; &lsquo;and when she
knew his purpose, she advised him by all means to keep his secret
close; for his old friend John Peerybingle was much too open in
his nature, and too clumsy in all artifice&mdash;being a clumsy
man in general,&rsquo; said Dot, half laughing and half
crying&mdash;&lsquo;to keep it for him.&nbsp; And when
she&mdash;that&rsquo;s me, John,&rsquo; sobbed the little
woman&mdash;&lsquo;told him all, and how his sweetheart had
believed him to be dead; and how she had at last been
over-persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly,
dear old thing called advantageous; and when
she&mdash;that&rsquo;s me again, John&mdash;told him they were
not yet married (though close upon it), and that it would be
nothing but a sacrifice if it went on, for there was no love on
her side; and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it; then
she&mdash;that&rsquo;s me again&mdash;said she would go between
them, as she had often done before in old times, John, and would
sound his sweetheart and be sure that what she&mdash;me again,
John&mdash;said and thought was right.&nbsp; And it was right,
John!&nbsp; And they were brought together, John!&nbsp; And they
were married, John, an hour ago!&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s the
Bride!&nbsp; And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor!&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;m a happy little woman, May, God bless
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was an irresistible little woman, if that be anything to
the purpose; and never so completely irresistible as in her
present transports.&nbsp; There never were congratulations so
endearing and delicious, as those she lavished on herself and on
the Bride.</p>
<p>Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the honest Carrier
had stood, confounded.&nbsp; Flying, now, towards her, Dot
stretched out her hand to stop him, and retreated as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, John, no!&nbsp; Hear all!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t love me
any more, John, till you&rsquo;ve heard every word I have to
say.&nbsp; It was wrong to have a secret from you, John.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m very sorry.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think it any harm,
till I came and sat down by you on the little stool last
night.&nbsp; But when I knew by what was written in your face,
that you had seen me walking in the gallery with Edward, and when
I knew what you thought, I felt how giddy and how wrong it
was.&nbsp; But oh, dear John, how could you, could you, think
so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Little woman, how she sobbed again!&nbsp; John Peerybingle
would have caught her in his arms.&nbsp; But no; she
wouldn&rsquo;t let him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t love me yet, please, John!&nbsp; Not for a
long time yet!&nbsp; When I was sad about this intended marriage,
dear, it was because I remembered May and Edward such young
lovers; and knew that her heart was far away from
Tackleton.&nbsp; You believe that, now.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you,
John?&rsquo;</p>
<p>John was going to make another rush at this appeal; but she
stopped him again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; keep there, please, John!&nbsp; When I laugh at
you, as I sometimes do, John, and call you clumsy and a dear old
goose, and names of that sort, it&rsquo;s because I love you,
John, so well, and take such pleasure in your ways, and
wouldn&rsquo;t see you altered in the least respect to have you
made a King to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hooroar!&rsquo; said Caleb with unusual vigour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My opinion!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when I speak of people being middle-aged, and
steady, John, and pretend that we are a humdrum couple, going on
in a jog-trot sort of way, it&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m such
a silly little thing, John, that I like, sometimes, to act a kind
of Play with Baby, and all that: and make believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She saw that he was coming; and stopped him again.&nbsp; But
she was very nearly too late.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t love me for another minute or two, if
you please, John!&nbsp; What I want most to tell you, I have kept
to the last.&nbsp; My dear, good, generous John, when we were
talking the other night about the Cricket, I had it on my lips to
say, that at first I did not love you quite so dearly as I do
now; that when I first came home here, I was half afraid I
mightn&rsquo;t learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and
prayed I might&mdash;being so very young, John!&nbsp; But, dear
John, every day and hour I loved you more and more.&nbsp; And if
I could have loved you better than I do, the noble words I heard
you say this morning, would have made me.&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; All the affection that I had (it was a great
deal, John) I gave you, as you well deserve, long, long ago, and
I have no more left to give.&nbsp; Now, my dear husband, take me
to your heart again!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my home, John; and never,
never think of sending me to any other!&rsquo;</p>
<p>You never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious
little woman in the arms of a third party, as you would have felt
if you had seen Dot run into the Carrier&rsquo;s embrace.&nbsp;
It was the most complete, unmitigated, soul-fraught little piece
of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your days.</p>
<p>You may be sure the Carrier was in a state of perfect rapture;
and you may be sure Dot was likewise; and you may be sure they
all were, inclusive of Miss Slowboy, who wept copiously for joy,
and wishing to include her young charge in the general
interchange of congratulations, handed round the Baby to
everybody in succession, as if it were something to drink.</p>
<p>But, now, the sound of wheels was heard again outside the
door; and somebody exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming
back.&nbsp; Speedily that worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm
and flustered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what the Devil&rsquo;s this, John
Peerybingle!&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
some mistake.&nbsp; I appointed Mrs. Tackleton to meet me at the
church, and I&rsquo;ll swear I passed her on the road, on her way
here.&nbsp; Oh! here she is!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, sir; I
haven&rsquo;t the pleasure of knowing you; but if you can do me
the favour to spare this young lady, she has rather a particular
engagement this morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t spare her,&rsquo; returned
Edward.&nbsp; &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, you vagabond?&rsquo; said
Tackleton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, that as I can make allowance for your being
vexed,&rsquo; returned the other, with a smile, &lsquo;I am as
deaf to harsh discourse this morning, as I was to all discourse
last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and the start he
gave!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry, sir,&rsquo; said Edward, holding out
May&rsquo;s left hand, and especially the third finger;
&lsquo;that the young lady can&rsquo;t accompany you to church;
but as she has been there once, this morning, perhaps
you&rsquo;ll excuse her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tackleton looked hard at the third finger, and took a little
piece of silver-paper, apparently containing a ring, from his
waistcoat-pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Slowboy,&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will
you have the kindness to throw that in the fire?&nbsp;
Thank&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a previous engagement, quite an old engagement,
that prevented my wife from keeping her appointment with you, I
assure you,&rsquo; said Edward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge
that I revealed it to him faithfully; and that I told him, many
times, I never could forget it,&rsquo; said May, blushing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh certainly!&rsquo; said Tackleton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh to
be sure.&nbsp; Oh it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite
correct.&nbsp; Mrs. Edward Plummer, I infer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the name,&rsquo; returned the
bridegroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I shouldn&rsquo;t have known you, sir,&rsquo; said
Tackleton, scrutinising his face narrowly, and making a low
bow.&nbsp; &lsquo;I give you joy, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Peerybingle,&rsquo; said Tackleton, turning
suddenly to where she stood with her husband; &lsquo;I am
sorry.&nbsp; You haven&rsquo;t done me a very great kindness,
but, upon my life I am sorry.&nbsp; You are better than I thought
you.&nbsp; John Peerybingle, I am sorry.&nbsp; You understand me;
that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite correct, ladies and
gentlemen all, and perfectly satisfactory.&nbsp; Good
morning!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With these words he carried it off, and carried himself off
too: merely stopping at the door, to take the flowers and favours
from his horse&rsquo;s head, and to kick that animal once, in the
ribs, as a means of informing him that there was a screw loose in
his arrangements.</p>
<p>Of course it became a serious duty now, to make such a day of
it, as should mark these events for a high Feast and Festival in
the Peerybingle Calendar for evermore.&nbsp; Accordingly, Dot
went to work to produce such an entertainment, as should reflect
undying honour on the house and on every one concerned; and in a
very short space of time, she was up to her dimpled elbows in
flour, and whitening the Carrier&rsquo;s coat, every time he came
near her, by stopping him to give him a kiss.&nbsp; That good
fellow washed the greens, and peeled the turnips, and broke the
plates, and upset iron pots full of cold water on the fire, and
made himself useful in all sorts of ways: while a couple of
professional assistants, hastily called in from somewhere in the
neighbourhood, as on a point of life or death, ran against each
other in all the doorways and round all the corners, and
everybody tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby,
everywhere.&nbsp; Tilly never came out in such force
before.&nbsp; Her ubiquity was the theme of general
admiration.&nbsp; She was a stumbling-block in the passage at
five-and-twenty minutes past two; a man-trap in the kitchen at
half-past two precisely; and a pitfall in the garret at
five-and-twenty minutes to three.&nbsp; The Baby&rsquo;s head
was, as it were, a test and touchstone for every description of
matter,&mdash;animal, vegetable, and mineral.&nbsp; Nothing was
in use that day that didn&rsquo;t come, at some time or other,
into close acquaintance with it.</p>
<p>Then, there was a great Expedition set on foot to go and find
out Mrs. Fielding; and to be dismally penitent to that excellent
gentlewoman; and to bring her back, by force, if needful, to be
happy and forgiving.&nbsp; And when the Expedition first
discovered her, she would listen to no terms at all, but said, an
unspeakable number of times, that ever she should have lived to
see the day! and couldn&rsquo;t be got to say anything else,
except, &lsquo;Now carry me to the grave:&rsquo; which seemed
absurd, on account of her not being dead, or anything at all like
it.&nbsp; After a time, she lapsed into a state of dreadful
calmness, and observed, that when that unfortunate train of
circumstances had occurred in the Indigo Trade, she had foreseen
that she would be exposed, during her whole life, to every
species of insult and contumely; and that she was glad to find it
was the case; and begged they wouldn&rsquo;t trouble themselves
about her,&mdash;for what was she? oh, dear! a nobody!&mdash;but
would forget that such a being lived, and would take their course
in life without her.&nbsp; From this bitterly sarcastic mood, she
passed into an angry one, in which she gave vent to the
remarkable expression that the worm would turn if trodden on;
and, after that, she yielded to a soft regret, and said, if they
had only given her their confidence, what might she not have had
it in her power to suggest!&nbsp; Taking advantage of this crisis
in her feelings, the Expedition embraced her; and she very soon
had her gloves on, and was on her way to John Peerybingle&rsquo;s
in a state of unimpeachable gentility; with a paper parcel at her
side containing a cap of state, almost as tall, and quite as
stiff, as a mitre.</p>
<p>Then, there were Dot&rsquo;s father and mother to come, in
another little chaise; and they were behind their time; and fears
were entertained; and there was much looking out for them down
the road; and Mrs. Fielding always would look in the wrong and
morally impossible direction; and being apprised thereof, hoped
she might take the liberty of looking where she pleased.&nbsp; At
last they came: a chubby little couple, jogging along in a snug
and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the Dot family;
and Dot and her mother, side by side, were wonderful to
see.&nbsp; They were so like each other.</p>
<p>Then, Dot&rsquo;s mother had to renew her acquaintance with
May&rsquo;s mother; and May&rsquo;s mother always stood on her
gentility; and Dot&rsquo;s mother never stood on anything but her
active little feet.&nbsp; And old Dot&mdash;so to call
Dot&rsquo;s father, I forgot it wasn&rsquo;t his right name, but
never mind&mdash;took liberties, and shook hands at first sight,
and seemed to think a cap but so much starch and muslin, and
didn&rsquo;t defer himself at all to the Indigo Trade, but said
there was no help for it now; and, in Mrs. Fielding&rsquo;s
summing up, was a good-natured kind of man&mdash;but coarse, my
dear.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed Dot, doing the honours in her
wedding-gown, my benison on her bright face! for any money.&nbsp;
No! nor the good Carrier, so jovial and so ruddy, at the bottom
of the table.&nbsp; Nor the brown, fresh sailor-fellow, and his
handsome wife.&nbsp; Nor any one among them.&nbsp; To have missed
the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal
as man need eat; and to have missed the overflowing cups in which
they drank The Wedding-Day, would have been the greatest miss of
all.</p>
<p>After dinner, Caleb sang the song about the Sparkling
Bowl.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;m a living man, hoping to keep so, for a
year or two, he sang it through.</p>
<p>And, by-the-by, a most unlooked-for incident occurred, just as
he finished the last verse.</p>
<p>There was a tap at the door; and a man came staggering in,
without saying with your leave, or by your leave, with something
heavy on his head.&nbsp; Setting this down in the middle of the
table, symmetrically in the centre of the nuts and apples, he
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Tackleton&rsquo;s compliments, and as he
hasn&rsquo;t got no use for the cake himself, p&rsquo;raps
you&rsquo;ll eat it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with those words, he walked off.</p>
<p>There was some surprise among the company, as you may
imagine.&nbsp; Mrs. Fielding, being a lady of infinite
discernment, suggested that the cake was poisoned, and related a
narrative of a cake, which, within her knowledge, had turned a
seminary for young ladies, blue.&nbsp; But she was overruled by
acclamation; and the cake was cut by May, with much ceremony and
rejoicing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think any one had tasted it, when there came
another tap at the door, and the same man appeared again, having
under his arm a vast brown-paper parcel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Tackleton&rsquo;s compliments, and he&rsquo;s sent
a few toys for the Babby.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t ugly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the delivery of which expressions, he retired again.</p>
<p>The whole party would have experienced great difficulty in
finding words for their astonishment, even if they had had ample
time to seek them.&nbsp; But they had none at all; for the
messenger had scarcely shut the door behind him, when there came
another tap, and Tackleton himself walked in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Peerybingle!&rsquo; said the Toy-merchant, hat in
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m more sorry
than I was this morning.&nbsp; I have had time to think of
it.&nbsp; John Peerybingle!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sour by disposition;
but I can&rsquo;t help being sweetened, more or less, by coming
face to face with such a man as you.&nbsp; Caleb!&nbsp; This
unconscious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night, of
which I have found the thread.&nbsp; I blush to think how easily
I might have bound you and your daughter to me, and what a
miserable idiot I was, when I took her for one!&nbsp; Friends,
one and all, my house is very lonely to-night.&nbsp; I have not
so much as a Cricket on my Hearth.&nbsp; I have scared them all
away.&nbsp; Be gracious to me; let me join this happy
party!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was at home in five minutes.&nbsp; You never saw such a
fellow.&nbsp; What <i>had</i> he been doing with himself all his
life, never to have known, before, his great capacity of being
jovial!&nbsp; Or what had the Fairies been doing with him, to
have effected such a change!</p>
<p>&lsquo;John! you won&rsquo;t send me home this evening; will
you?&rsquo; whispered Dot.</p>
<p>He had been very near it though!</p>
<p>There wanted but one living creature to make the party
complete; and, in the twinkling of an eye, there he was, very
thirsty with hard running, and engaged in hopeless endeavours to
squeeze his head into a narrow pitcher.&nbsp; He had gone with
the cart to its journey&rsquo;s end, very much disgusted with the
absence of his master, and stupendously rebellious to the
Deputy.&nbsp; After lingering about the stable for some little
time, vainly attempting to incite the old horse to the mutinous
act of returning on his own account, he had walked into the
tap-room and laid himself down before the fire.&nbsp; But
suddenly yielding to the conviction that the Deputy was a humbug,
and must be abandoned, he had got up again, turned tail, and come
home.</p>
<p>There was a dance in the evening.&nbsp; With which general
mention of that recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had
not some reason to suppose that it was quite an original dance,
and one of a most uncommon figure.&nbsp; It was formed in an odd
way; in this way.</p>
<p>Edward, that sailor-fellow&mdash;a good free dashing sort of a
fellow he was&mdash;had been telling them various marvels
concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans, and gold dust, when
all at once he took it in his head to jump up from his seat and
propose a dance; for Bertha&rsquo;s harp was there, and she had
such a hand upon it as you seldom hear.&nbsp; Dot (sly little
piece of affectation when she chose) said her dancing days were
over; <i>I</i> think because the Carrier was smoking his pipe,
and she liked sitting by him, best.&nbsp; Mrs. Fielding had no
choice, of course, but to say <i>her</i> dancing days were over,
after that; and everybody said the same, except May; May was
ready.</p>
<p>So, May and Edward got up, amid great applause, to dance
alone; and Bertha plays her liveliest tune.</p>
<p>Well! if you&rsquo;ll believe me, they have not been dancing
five minutes, when suddenly the Carrier flings his pipe away,
takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into the room, and starts
off with her, toe and heel, quite wonderfully.&nbsp; Tackleton no
sooner sees this, than he skims across to Mrs. Fielding, takes
her round the waist, and follows suit.&nbsp; Old Dot no sooner
sees this, than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs. Dot in the
middle of the dance, and is the foremost there.&nbsp; Caleb no
sooner sees this, than he clutches Tilly Slowboy by both hands
and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy, firm in the belief that
diving hotly in among the other couples, and effecting any number
of concussions with them, is your only principle of footing
it.</p>
<p>Hark! how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp,
Chirp; and how the kettle hums!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>But what is this!&nbsp; Even as I listen to them, blithely,
and turn towards Dot, for one last glimpse of a little figure
very pleasant to me, she and the rest have vanished into air, and
I am left alone.&nbsp; A Cricket sings upon the Hearth; a broken
child&rsquo;s-toy lies upon the ground; and nothing else
remains.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
